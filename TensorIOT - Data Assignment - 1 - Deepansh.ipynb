      "No adverse comment. Gift for college student. If you like strong tea, this is for you. It might even be a little too strong for me. Love the tea. The flavor is way better than the regular Lipton black tea. Definetly worth the money. I have searched everywhere until I browsed Amazon and found it!  This is the tea Lipton should be selling on grocery store shelves.  The stuff I last purchased is just awful, and nowhere near as good as I remember. Tea made with Lipton Yellow Label teabags is much better than tea made with regular Lipton teabags. I love this tea!  Okay, I'm not a high falutin' tea snob, but I first enjoyed this Lipton yellow label tea when on a trip to Singapore, and whether it was the room service, the company, or the country - it left such a favorable impression on me, I search it out whenever possible.  Maybe it's the same as the USA's white label Lipton tea, but the yellow label tea appears to me to be smoother and more mellow.  I would highly recommend it - give it a try! Discovered this tea at a local Med. Rest....a great tea, have been sharing with friends.  Everyone likes it and will be ordering more.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this tea, otherwise not available where we live. Well I bought this tea after being in Malaysia for several months, mostly to try making teh tarik without using loose tea as we did several times. I failed with regular Lipton black tea, thought the difference must be because of Yellow label. That turned out to be wrong, the problem is the condensed milk which is clearly different in Malaysia than what I've been able to get in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say the taste is marginally different than regular Lipton black tea, if you had me do a blind taste test I'm not convinced I would be able to know which I was drinking with a reliable success rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered 4 boxes and the packaging was sealed well, but it has this unmistakable dust-like taste that is ruining the tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I've gone through 2 boxes and only the first had the dusty taste. The others are fine, and pretty much taste the same as regular Lipton black tea We really like this tea.  It is definitely different from the regular yellow box of 100 that I get in the stores.  You can tell the difference when you drop them into hot water.  They sink much faster than the regular ones.  In the end, I think they have a somewhat stronger flavor that is good.  I plan to keep buying these. Hard to find in the U.S.A.  Exactly as described, good quality. I make the best brewed iced tea with this yellow label Lipton tea. I make it by the gallon using the same amount as regular loose teas. I only add 1/4 cup of sugar per gallon. This tea has quickly replaced soda and tastes even better. After opening, I transfer the entire contents into a glass container (not plastic) with a metal screwed lid to keep the air out. We love this tea and hope Amazon keeps carrying it. I have recently started drinking hot tea again (since my childhood when Grandma made us hot tea with milk & sugar) and have been trying different types and brands of tea to find my favorites.  I can't speak the tea lover's lingo (full-bodied, smoky with hints of arsnic, etc.) but this tea is decent.  I use it mostly to make iced tea but I drink it hot occasionally too.  I have been completely spoiled on Dilmah tea & now any others seem inferior.  Lipton Yellow Label is definitely better than PG Tips! I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste.  I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas.  I probably won't buy more of this tea since there are so many others out there to try but I plan to use up the rest of what I bought.  If anyone wants some PG Tips let me know & I'll send it to you for the price of shipping!! I like pretty much all of Lipton's tea... I just don't see any difference from this tea to all the other types on Lipton loose teas. I was watching a youtube video about buying tea in New York and there was a guy from somewhere in the Pakistan, Afghanistan area who went to tea shops serving their ethnic choices of tea. In one of the shops they prepared I think it was called Kashmiri tea, I watched them put the ingredients in and they used this box of tea. I liked the final product. I tweeked the ratio of ingredients to my liking. Long story short, this tea is potent and I think only best for hot tea. it was ok, but it didn't taste like the Lipton of my youth that i loved so much. Maybe Iv'e just become too much of a tea snob! Great taste use it for cold brew - works great. Excellent flavor-- I cold brew and mix  1/2 tsp lemon juce with THM sweetener blends - great!!!! Best tea for my single cup coffee maker. I purchased stainless steel single cup reusable. Make fresh tea every time. So much better than tea bags. Good tea. Way better than baseline Lipton tea. The baseline Lipton tea is more of a powder, where this tea is in a granular-form. It brews much better/more efficiently. It has a really deep (almost chocolate-like) flavor. Much deeper/more potent than their bagged tea. I usually prefer Lipton teas, however, I did not give it 5-stars because while it is good, it is not as good as some others (Tetley, PG Tips, Taylors and Peet's, now Mighty Leaf. Orange Pekoe tea is considered (in the U.S.) as a budget tea and not a premium tea. This Lipton tea is priced accordingly. This tea looks like coffee grounds. Brewed it once and threw it out. OK tea. My second favorite tea!  Drink lots it'll make your day better.  It's not for tea drinkers who like weak tea.  It is dark and rich. Excellent product, price, shipping. Half yellow label and half black tea brewed in a French coffee pot works perfect for my taste excellent Less bitter than the Lipton black tea sold in most US supermarkets Good tea flavor. Not the best I've ever had, but it is good, and the price is very reasonable. I am happy with this tea as an addition to the various teas I keep. The tea is wonderful. I can't find it in any regular store near me. My only problem, and it's a big one, is these were to be gifts but that is very hard when there is a big price sticker on the front of the box. I wrote the review for this tea for the other regular liptons\n",
      "great stuff, blends well with flavored creamers\n",
      "less bitter holds up well when strong\n",
      "taste good with various water and various brewing methods and strengths\n",
      "a good everyday drinker\n",
      "I will buy again , and again, and , again.... This is the best flavor tea for iced tea I have found.\n",
      "Add a little jasmine tea or other flavoring. Most pre-flavored teas are too strong flavoring.\n",
      "Use this tea with a small amount of valilla or other tea, and you can get a great iced tea with just a hint of other flavor! this tea is the bomb, for the real die-hard industrial-strength tea drinker who likes their tea indian or middle eastern style (especially when sweet, though no milk for me, please). clear, robust, flavorful, it brews up a lovely red liquor in less time than it takes to find your favorite teacup, and is also a great base into which to blend more expensive teas (kusmi russian evening or morning tea, for example) for special occasions--like this beautiful may morning's breakfast on the porch. if i were an ancient egyptian and i were leaving instructions for what to put in my tomb to supply the afterlife in amenti, i would ask for this. lots of this. amen. This is NOT the regular Lipton's Tea sold in the USA.  This Lipton's Yellow Label Tea is what most of the rest of the world drinks when they drink Lipton's.  It is not acidic as is the regular USA version we all know (IE: no pucker/dry mouth).  It is bold, but mellow--sometimes with a hint of smoky flavor.  We first drank this while living overseas, I love this Yellow Label tea.  It is very good made as hot tea as well as iced.  Very good with milk or cream.  I have purchased this for years and will definitely purchase this again! We discovered 'Yellow Label' tea while in S.E.Asia. It was strong, consistently fresh, but never bitter. The tea comes as tiny rolled leaves (ie: balls). Even after brewing it remains as balls-- easier to get out of the cup than leaves. suits my taste perfectly.  it is a robust black tea.  best if you buy the loose tea rather than the tea bags. My husband and I enjoy this loose orange pekoe tea.  It has a more committed flavor than the tea bags, which we're happy to have. I bought this because I miss the taste of the Lipton tea I grew up with. When I was young, Lipton tasted so pure, and you had to hurry and take the tea out of the hot water before it got too strong. It also had more of a clear, astringent quality. Hard to explain. So I haven't had that experience in a long time, no matter whether I buy the bags or loose. Has Lipton changed since I was young? (I'm talking 1960s-70's- maybe later.) I've noticed a lot of food items have changed quality since then and have used cheaper ingredients and / or you get less. Anybody else remember a difference in the old Lipton? I thought buying the loose from Europe (which I think this is) would be better, but it's not. Glad I have some now - this is tough to find at the local store.  Makes a nice cup of tea - if you know what you're buying you'll enjoy this, if you are used to loose leaves or little bags filled with powder then try a smaller size first to see if this is what you like.  I love it - I like a full bodied cup of tea and this fills the cup\n",
      "perfectly--I have already ordered this product over\n",
      "and over again--Amazon has a great price so give\n",
      "it a try I know you'll like it--it is very rich, full cup of\n",
      "tea. Now as sweet and fragrant as the regular Lipton Orange Pekoe tea bags sold in the supermarket. I was disappointed. Excelente The best coffee ever I love it been using this coffee for years and love the taste i did not realize it was so full of sugar and powdered cream...which i would not use\n",
      "  i would sometime like to try one without sugar and powdered cream....more healthy\n",
      " that way as i thought this Organo gold company was all about health Yum! enjoy this coffee and have not been able to buy from Organo. Thanks The Oregano Cafe Supreme is a really wonderful cup of coffee. My two favorite coffees are the Norwegian cooffe and Oregano Cafe supreme. In my travels around these are the two coffees I have enjoyed the most. I actually take them with me when I travel. I love the one in the black box and all of the benefits. More energy. Great taste with non diary creamer. No sugar necessary. It is worth the price. Actually I used the black box. The gold cafe supreme was not suitable for me. I have both the red and green curry paste.  The green is milder.  I use both of them in variety of dishes and often spice up soups and stews that need a little zing.  It is so convient to have them in the frig. I live in Puerto Rico and cannot find Thai food here, let alone ingredients.\n",

      "a bit of product in the container, so it will last if refrigerated.  Watch the shipping\n",
      "costs from outside vendors. They will not combine shipping in some cases. Use very sparingly unless you love very spicy food! Super tasty! I LOVE this curry paste.  It beats Thai Kitchen hands down, I bought that recently in a pinch and I was SORELY disappointed.  This container is HUGE and will last you FOREVER.  Seriously, I have this in green, red, and yellow, and one container will last me several years.  It may be different for you depending on how often you make curry.  The ingredients for this paste are clean and are whole30 and paleo compliant.  The flavor is amazing, and I usually only need about 1 tbsp of this paste to deliver all of the robust flavor I need.  This container is about the size of a pint of ice cream, but not as tall.  But yes, it's large.  The paste comes in a sealed plastic bag inside of the plastic container.  I just cut a corner off the top and squeeze out what I need.  I store the rest folded up in the plastic container and keep it in my cabinet with my other spices.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this stuff is and how nothing compares. Has good flavor, but flavor should be stronger.  Spice is stronger than flavor. Absolutely LOVE this!!! It's spicy but sooooo flavorful. My hubby is a try curry fan (he's a brit) and he LOVED this. Once container is enough to make 4-5 good sized meals. I won't buy any other curry paste again! I love this stuff but you gotta be really accurate in how much you use.  I like my soups spicy but I have made it too spicy and salty by adding too much.  This will be a staple in the fridge tho. This comes in a sealed plastic bag within the carton, cut it open and squeeze or spoon it in the lidded container. I have made several curried soups, vegetable and chicken dishes and am so pleased with the intricate flavors. This Mae Ploy brand has more heat than other green curry pastes I have used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fabulous flavor and a generous amount, fast delivery and a good price. tastes authentic I like it, but it's definitely more spicy than I was anticipating!  Once I use up this green curry, I'll probably try the red. be warned this is very spicy..don't use the recommended amount on the package.use much less. Didn't expect that homemade green curry can taste this professional. Actually very delicious, especially with meat and vegetable cooked in coconut milk! favorite brand of curry paste Great Product I ordered both the green and red curry pastes made by Mae Ploy after reading a recommendation in \"Sous Vide at Home,\" a great book that I have on Kindle. I make red curry dishes frequently and always used Thai Kitchen brand. But the teeny jars were not to my liking and I wasn't crazy about their green curry. The Mae Ploy red is super, but it was the green that's our new favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used it for the first time last week when I was preparing dishes for a private-chef client who's on a low, low carb diet for his recently diagnosed diabetes 2 and wanted to make him something punchy and flavorful. Not only did he love the dish, but he gave some to his mother-in-law (who's also diabetic) and she loved it, too. My husband cruised by the kitchen when I was cooking, intrigued by the delicious aromas and was disappointed that it was for Bruce and not for us. So over the weekend, I made green curry halibut and shrimp \"burgers,\" and they were such a success I'm making the same thing for Bruce's wife who's a pescatarian; the first dish featured chicken thighs..\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that Mae Ploy uses all real ingredients in their curry paste and the generous amount in the package means I don't have to go through lots of little jars. The heat level is perfect. It's hotter than the red, but not so spicy that you can't taste the other flavors in the dish. And if you can't tell that I'm all about the green curry right now, I'm using it again tonight in a pork and vegetable dish for company. We eat a paleo diet with lots of vegetables and with some coconut milk and few other additions to the curry paste plus some meat or seafood, I can make a healthy dish with huge flavors that's easy to prepare. Win, win, win. Superb! This paste is authentic Green Curry Thai paste. I wish it came in a larger size. I've used most of it already and need to order more. I've used it in numerous styles of green curry dishes from meats to vegan and it always turns out \"WOW\" delicious!. If you are pondering this, think no further, you won't be sorry with your purchase if you love green curry. I store this in the refrigerator between uses and it has lasted for months without issue. good Easy to make Thai dishes now with green curry at my fingertips.  Excellent flavor.  My guests are always begging for recipe.  It's so easy.  A couple of Tablespoons and you can transform your vegetables and meats into a family treat! Very hot. Use just a tiny bit in soups - adds a bite - too much, and it overwhelms the soup. The 14oz containers are a great value. Good flavor. Mae Ploy seems to be a bit salty/heavy on the Fish Sauce. So I chunk up a couple potatoes and put them in the curry as it simmers, and that absorbs a lot of the salt. This curry paste has a bit of kick, so taste it first before adding your own ginger, galangal, or hot chili peppers. Lasts for months in the fridge, no worries. I absolutely love this curry paste. I just got a new shipment of green, red and panang. It lasted from June of 2015. Kept in its bag and original cup in the fridge.  Green is the hottest and all have very distinct  and different flavors. It's easy to whip up a tasty, authentic dinner, usually with cubed chicken and eggplant or zucchini, carrots and bamboo shoots. I like it hot, so I use a good amount. If you don't like spicy, use very sparingly but be prepared for less flavor.  Serve over cooled Jasmine rice This is good stuff! But if you can't take the heat, like my family can't, just use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. Then it's the perfect amount of heat and spice. ok Def the best of all Mae Ploy's curries. Very easy to make very good Thai food now. My favorite.  Keeps in your fridge for ever.  Flavor is spot on.  Exactly what I ordered.  This is the one to buy. Love this line of curry paste. Great stuff. I'm so happy for this brand. I have not the patience to make all my own seasonings for all the curries, and these pastes have been a headache saver. I don't have to store spices that will go bland with this. Just keep in the back of my fridge and it's ready to use when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not being a huge fan of Green curry previously, but knowing I love this brand, I got this for a recipe. It's fantastic. Probably my new favorite. We make a noodle soup dish with veggies and it comes out tasting like my favorite soup: Tom Kah. But without any additional ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much recommend all their flavors, but this one is spectacular all on it's own. By far the best pasted I've used, even better if you purchase lime leaves to add to the mix. Best green curry paste. A little goes a long way. Unless you want to burn your mouth out, add in small quantities. Has a great flavour! Love it. Tastes great, authentic. Comes shrimp curry, friends loved it. I have always made my own curry but it is pointless to spend all that time when this goodness is at my fingertips. I used to spend hours cooking down the spices but this just needs chili oil and some coconut cream and you are ready to go. I highly rec buying a jar of the kaffir  lime to sprinkle on top. I bought all three flavors. It is super hot and concentrated flavor, making it very economical to use. Most recipes call for 3 tablespoons for a four person dish, but I can only withstand one taablespoon in a full recipe. 14 oz is a lot of curry paste. I have had it in my refrigerator for one year and it is still good and strong. With so much spice and heat, it will not spoil. Wonderful This brand is ok if you like it really  (REALLY) spicy. But it's so bland that you have to use a lot of it. By that time it's too hot too eat and still doesn't have a lot of flavor that I'm used to in the traditional Thai dish. Delicious.  Makes a ton of curry! Love this and the Red Curry.  Very simple to make.  Put about 2 tablespoons in a pot with tablespoon of Oil, heat it up and stir then and add whatever meat and veggies you want with about 2 cups of coconut milk.  I can have a meal in about 15 minutes. I was glad to find some Thai \"green curry paste,\" since we've moved to an area with far fewer Asian products available.  In the past, I've had the powder (\"phuket\"), and frankly, I'd rather have it in that form.  One thing I thought was odd with this product is that it comes in a plastic bag, so you need to squeeze it out into the jar for storage.  The paste is really thick, so it's a minor chore.  I guess the plastic bag is more secure in shipping than if they covered the inner rim in plastic, like so many other companies do. Good yellow curry paste ,flavor is excellent... Small container a bit pricey My husband likes it. I was not too thrilled with shrimp paste but decided to try it because there is no gmo soy or canola like the other new variety I was considering. I usually buy miews flying pan or marions kitchen.\n",
      "It is waaaaay to spicy. Especially for western pallets. I love spicy food but we used 1/4 of recipe on package and still unedible to me. My husband has a cast iron stomach, I still will order med hot to hot at ethnic restaurants just fine.\n",
      "I did not like the spice seems to be red chile in favor and not curry spice.\n",
      "I also found this very oily and do not know why. Somewhat hot if you use as much as the directions suggest (you will need a magnifying glass to read the directions). Very good paste for curries. great product for a good price! I have ordered this before.  Very good flavor, This is the real deal. Authentic and delicious. Not a lot of fillers like some brands. It's pretty much solid spices. Just be aware that it is pretty spicy, unless you only use a little. We followed the cooking directions carefully, but the curry didn't turn out so well. It was 1) super spicy, 2) extremely watery, and 3) no flavor. Quite disappointed. I'm sure we just need to tweak the recipe a little and adjust to taste at our next attempt at perfecting this dish. Despite the disappoint, this paste is really authentic and smells so good. Our entire apartment smelled like heaven as the paste was slowly bubbling on the stove. Also, it's much more expensive on Amazon - I found the exact same thing at my local Korean market for about $2.50. We love it! Awesome, strong, curry flavor. Best one we've had so far! Great tasting curry with many possible uses. This stuff is HOT.  But it has serious flavor, too.  I find I want to eat it more than once a week.  Start out using a quarter of that suggested on the label.  I will be a MAE PLOY fan until  .... a great product This tastes just like in Thai restaurants great Love green curry and this is very tasty. Love this product a little goes a long ways taste so good I made a chicken and coconut Thai soup today! Really good green curry paste: we think it has a good balance of green curry elements.  Combine this with some coconut milk, add whatever else you want (garlic, ginger, nampla, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass) and you are on your way. Great to add a nice Thai element to other dishes too. Use sparingly...very spicy and hot We only use Mae Ploy curry pastes, and green is definitely our favorite. We also get panang and yellow, which are also 5-star, but we just prefer the green over them. Has the best ingredient list of all the curries. This jar probably makes 20 huge batches of curry or more, each of which feed our family of three. Wonderful Curry - love it.  This helps me to make Green Curry as good as, if not better than any Thai Food place! This green curry tastes so good and can not go wrong.\n",
      "According to the instruction, I have to use Coconut milk for the base instead of regular milk.\n",
      "I m too lazy to drive to asian market to get the coconut milk and it is expensive like 3$.\n",
      "I used coconut oil to stir fry the vegetables and curry then I pour regular 2% reduced fat milk and It really works.\n",
      "The flavor is soo authentic without weird smell. The consistency is good and it goes well with any vegetables.\n",
      "I put broccoli, carrots, mushroom, potatoes.\n",
      "If this is too spicey or too saulty for you, put eggs and stir really well. Makes great curry The best curry paste out there. A little dab will do you and it keeps in the fridge almost indefinitely. I love it, a little bit goes a long way so I freeze it. Best there is for green curry. as described and shipped on time tastey Good stuff. Would order again. yum I have Mae Ploy Yellow Curry and Panang Red Curry Paste and I love them.  So, I thought I'd try the green paste.  I don't like it as well as the other two, but it is tasty and very hot.  Next time I make it I'll use less than a tablespoon.  I like hot and spicy curry but this made my eyes water!  A tip, though, is to eat applesauce as a side with this and it definitely cools down your mouth. It was bit expensive. Chinese market was a little cheaper.lol I have tried this twice, but failed to make delicious food. A little bit disappointed. Did not say that it contains shrimp Never cooked curry before.  This makes it so simple.  I just follow the directions.  You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want.  I use a heaping table spoon (silverware, not a measuring spoon) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk, and about a pound of meat or shrimp.  It's hot, but not crazy hot.  I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch, and it was way too hot for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats, and I give a partial stir fry to mine, to give it a little color, before adding it to my curry mixture. Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry doesn't have time to penetrate it.  I use light coconut milk, so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat.  Add sugar and to taste until you get it where you want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as good as the Thai restaurant I eat at!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll try the Panang next. So many flavors. I can't begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries. I should ask them for recipes. Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wanna say two and one half yogurts. It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry. Its all mashed in there. I cut a corner and take out  a little at a time. Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything. Veggies love it that are steamed, scrambled eggs, rice pasta and even fish and meat. Couldn't say a bad word about this product.\n",
      "The taste is phenomenal and saved me\n",
      "a TON of TIME in that I did not have to make it Beware!  Lots of hot spice.  Use just a teaspoon and adjust slowly.  Personally I prefer the Thai Kitchen brand whivh hss more lemongrass and less heat. This paste is a bit mouth hurting hot, but once I figured out the right mix, it was great.  You cannot beat this for making green curry dishes of any kind.  I may even use this in flavoring some rice. I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste don't really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so) My cousin dorsher loves green curry and Mae ploy Is his favorite he doesn't need cookware just a spoon because he thinks its pudding, I tried to cook this for him with some dog noses but he screamed at me. \"DORSHER TO DUNGEON! DORSHER TO DUNGEON!\" I guess he feels like he's in a dungeon when offered real food?  Oh well. Mae Ploy Green Curry Paste. I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry: 1) I want it to taste good and 2) I want whomever I'm making it for to feel like it's fairly authentic. Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper). I love ethnic foods and to cook them. I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment, so I was back to the drawing board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reviews won me over, and free shipping, so I ordered one of each, red and green. Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW! It made me look like a gourmet international chef - it is so incredibly good!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was definitely hot, though, which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base. This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always. Along with a can of coconut milk, this marvelous Green curry paste is the foundation for a fairly authentic Thai meal.  Follow the instructions--starting with a little oil, fry 2-4 tab. of the paste for a few seconds to bring out the flavor, add the coconut milk, meat and veggies.  Toward the end, add sugar to taste and, for tartness, add either fish sauce or lime juice.  Enjoy.  Depending on the time I have, I augment the sauce with kafir lime leaves, basil and fresh garlic and/or ginger.  But these additions not needed, but give the sauce a bit more zing. Being newbie to THai cooking, these are great addition to my kitchen. Its tastes really good for vegetable and chicken curry. This curry paste makes a delicious curry.  I just fried up some chicken and vegetables and added coconut milk to this for a delicious dish.  Quite spicy, so if you're looking for something mild, look elsewhere I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!! Excellent strong green curry taste! My husband finished his bowl and said I should open a restaurant!  Great product! I will buy again! If you know what you're doing, (by which I mean, you know how to enhance a curry to draw out subtle flavors), this is a fine product. However, used alone, it's not going to create a dish that blows your palate-mind. It's good, yes, but it's very basic. So, using it and creating a great curry is going to take some finessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've shopped locally, you'll know this is a terrific price. Just be prepared to have plenty of essential other ingredients available to make your dish really sing. Hadn't had green curry before so I bought this to give it a try.  Turned out really good and I loved the heat level I got using 2 Tbs of paste.  I ordered the red paste too but haven't gotten to try it yet, but if it's as good at this paste it should be way better than what my grocery store carries. I find myself using this in much more than intended when I purchased it - tomato soup, rice dishes, in a sauce for vegetables, you name it.  It occasionally gives me shivers, I kid you not.  I keep it in the freezer and after several months it seems to be staying fresh as well as not turning into a solid chunk. I've used this a lot recently in some of my chicken dishes. I don't use a lot, I do like spicy foods and a little goes a long way. The plus is its in a bag and you can squeeze out what you need.. Yes I will buy more I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor. I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand. Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types. I like other styles of Mae Ploy curry paste, but the green just doesn't work for me. Overwhelming garlic, no heat, and very bland. I would not purchase this product again. Because of Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste, green thai curry has become my signature dish. I am always being asked to make it. Remember that it is very spicy so a little goes a long way. The flavors in this paste are complex and varied and make for a delicious curry. We are living overseas (not in Thailand) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon! Everyone who has had the opportunity to eat this loves this - I like this a lot with green and yellow zuccini, carrots and bamboo shoots with thin sliced turkey breast. Living too far from any real good oriental restaurants is no longer such a bummer...just came back to order more... price went up a bit but it's still well worth it.\n",

      "I see some complaints about too salty - I don't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)...the hot sensation goes away very quickly...we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat. Curry has officially become my FAVORITE food over the past year. I can't believe I waited 35 years to try it.\n",

      "Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park! We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry. These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)\n",

My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored.  I don't do massive amounts of baking, and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture.  However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.  The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things. This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors.  Colors are  vibrant, and do not taint the frosting like some colors can.  These are  simple to use, and do not make a mess.  My only complaint is that I did not  find these years ago.  This is a must have if you decorate often! The gel food coloring is great for ALL colors except black.  It appears to be black and then when you actually squirt out any of it, it is instead a dark green.  This was highly disappointing as I bought this pack entirely for the black gel coloring.  Otherwise the other colors are as advertised and very vibrant. Gluten-free. Does the job!  I switched from Wilton for making hard candy.  Ateco works better and blends quickly during boiling process (no stirring).  For one batch of hard candy I've found that 2 drops (not 1, not 3) is perfect. If you are looking for deep saturated colors, these are the ones for you. I had to use more than I expected while coloring white fondant but the colors were nice and bright and the farm cake turned out beautiful! Caution, wear gloves as these will stain your hands. This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative. They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this...I am \"returning\" item. I am trying to avoid my children's exposure to yellow 5, red 40 and so on...I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause. This may be fine for someone that doesn't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family. I really think this is a great product.  I was leary of buying it over the internet.  Worried that it might spill, or break open and get all over the other products I ordered.  They work great and you really don't have to use a whole lot of the gel. I bought it purposely because it came with black. I needed just a little black coloring and this safed the day.  Great product. I use these to color my macarons. Very vibrant, only need a touch and they are good! The fold and mix really easily into the warm egg meringue. I did a search for Natural (non chemical) food coloring.  This is the first thing that shows up on the list of items.  However, they are NOT natural food coloring.  Loads of Red40, which my daughter can't have due to ADHD.  More of a fault with Amazon listings than the product or description, but I thought others should be forewarned. These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to clean - don't stain after they've been made into whatever craft.\n",

      "Good product for the price! Works perfect.  Made strips and pepperoni sticks,  Just wish it held more meat. Easy to use, and more importantly to clean after using same.  Everything comes apart for ease of cleaning.  Recommend product. I had no idea that lean hamburger could be used for making jerky.  This Jerky Works Kit is amazing - makes it so easy! Inexpensive. Makes uniform strips of jerky. Dismantles for easy cleaning. The included seasoning packets make great tasting jerky. I wish it held a larger amount of meat though. For a pound of meat, you will have to reload about 3 times. The Nesco American Harvest Jerky Works has made jerky preparation a snap! The homemade jerky is comparable to the jerky sticks you can purchase in stores. The process is simple ground meat of your choice, spice and cure. Load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round. Dependent upon your food dehydrator you can have jerky in a matter of hours. Replacement spices and cures can be found at most larger department/retail  stores. Thanks Amazon.com for recommending this product! Excellent product. My fave cough drop. I always keep a stock at home. Specially in cold season. It's hard to find this flavor in any store. Great product! I'm using them for the throat, but not for cough. My throat's been dry and scratchy, especially after singing and these little guys have helped! They are a great second choice to the original natural herb drops from Ricola!! These tasty lemon drops are saving my teeth. I have a dry mouth and because of that was getting cavities frequently. My dentist wanted to do a cleaning every 3 months. I suddenly realized after using these good tasting drops with excellent ingredients I haven't gotten cavities in 2 years. I'm so grateful for this great product that is composed of healthy ingredients. It's also saving me money. love it! very good Good, a bit overpriced for only 19 drops. Good cough drops/sore throat drops As expected Soothing yet strong...great! Run of the mill. Healthier but boring. Just as promised, timely arrival. I do not produce saliva due to an auto immune disease and the sugar free Ricola help with that. I especially like that they're sugar free Sugar Free - 19 Ea / Pack of original Ricola Herb Drops.\n",

      "And and FYI they do contain gluten if that is of issue to you, or those in your household. This stuff is expensive, doesn't stay soft & loses flavor quickly.  I could deal with all that if it worked but I just don't think it works any better to relieve dry mouth than regular sugar-free gum. I have to start a course of chemotherapy; and my dentist recommended this gum to me to chew during the months I am on chemo. I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!\n",

      "You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask your dentist if you have any questions. I like chewing gum for my dry mouth, but Biotene is not my favorite: it is expensive, hard to find, and, in my opinion, not any better than many traditional chewing gums.  You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.  Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum. (I do like Biotene toothpaste , though.) As a dentist I see many patients that have dry mouth as a result of medication use or due to cancer radiation therapy of the head and neck area.  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS.  Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth.  Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.\n",

      "This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Jim \"Konedog\" Koenig, DDS Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. This is a great tea. Flavor is good, works well, priced right and fast shipping. If you like herbal teas, try it, you'll like it. Yummy and works nicely! I drink this tea at night just before bed. It helps with my respiratory problem. I could breathe. And it helps me sleep as well. Purchasing this item on Amazon was a great idea. Fast delivery. Good price. Great value. Repeat customer of product and enjoy it I love the traditional Medicinals teas, and i especially love the 15% subscribe and save Amazon discount. Works very well . I was impressed with how quickly this started opening up my cold-congested nostrils and even my sinuses. I got this to see if it matched up to the sinus soother. It didn't. My husband has a lot of issues and the sinus soother can completely clear him up. This just didn't. This tea has helped me through bronchitis twice and whenever I get the sniffles which always goes down into my chest. Plus it tastes really good, too.  I put a bag or two in my water mug and drink it all day. I like Traditional Medicines teas. Nice After coughing for months, I decided to try this tea.  Nothing over the counter helped at all.  I didn't like the idea of buying such a large quantity, but when the tea gave me real relief, I was glad for the purchase.  I had enough boxes of tea to share with friends who were also suffering from the flu or colds or allergies going around.  It seemed so amazing that Breathe Easy worked so well.  When I finally went to the doctor, he diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed a daily inhaler as prevention for future attacks.  I will continue to use this tea whenever I start to feel congestion and cough.  This is a product everyone should have in the cupboard just in case. I love this tea, and it does seem to help clear up sinuses, and it tastes great.  I should be drinking it more often. I love, love, love this tea. It is my favorite of the Traditional Medicinals tea. It has a licorice thing going on and I happen to really like that. Not so much a licorice flavor but the chest action that it gives you. It really works. Also, this can make quite a cup of tea. I have one of those mega-mugs and this made even that size... maybe like 16oz?- with one bag, still strong and wonderful. If you are sick, asthmatic, or have a tight chest for any reason... go for Breathe Easy. It helps, when you have allergies and are just trying to be less stuffed up. great organic caffeine free tea My acupuncturist said Bi Yan Pian is good for allergies and sinus problems.  I suffer from extreme allergies and am going through acupuncture to get rid of my body's reaction to these allergies.  In the meantime going off antihistamines this tea really works wonders. The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins.  Antihistamines dry you making the toxins stay in your body and oh yeah it lowers your immunity so you get sick.  Good reason to go off anithistamines.  This tea tastes very good with the combination; I use honey with ginger and that is amazing.  I will continue using this tea as needed because it works so well if I drink too much I'm actually too dry...but then the acupuncture is part of that too.  Hope this helps you decide. I have had some breathing problems for a few year and medication only helped so much.  I don't especially care for the flavor warm. I found that brewing the tea letting it coll adding a bit of honey pouring over ice make it quite enjoyable. Does seem to help clear my breathing passages. I breathe so much easier with this tea! It helps me cut my medications in half! Very good product.  I like the aroma and taste and how relaxing it is. My favorite tea for the morning. Mildly sweet with hints of licorice. Wakes a person up gently! This tea works absolutely the best for me when I have upper respiratory congestion related to seasonal pollen. I noticed a significant improvement in my breathing after having this tea. I purchased it initially at a natural co-op grocery. I had been having some lung irritation after being exposed to perfumes as well as automobile exhaust.  After that, I decided to buy more of it here at Amazon. This stuff works. Not sure why, but it does. Helps with the asthma. I drink one of these breathe easy teas each morning, helps with congestion. I drink this every day to support my lung health. This product is does what its says I find having this every morning gives me a boost with breathing. This is my all time favorite tea.....love it! Love it By far, the tea that helps with my chronic allergies the best. It's nice to have a cup of tea rather than taking an over the counter allergy medicine. Excellent, as expected I bought this tea for my mom who suffers from pretty bad asthma and thought it might help her a bit. She has told me that its just ok. She has not really noticed an improvement but likes the taste. Better than any allopathic products for colds and allergies. I am happy. ;) Breathe easy actually works to cut down on my nasal congestions when my alleges act up. The flavor is mostly licorice. Have been drinking this tea for years.  I used to get Bronchitis all the time and this was what helped me most with the coughing and congestion.  Even now, when I eat something that gives me mucus, this clears it up right away and I am able to sleep. If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all. If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful! It tastes great (I enjoy it  myself) and it is an effective breathing aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**of course this is not medical advice, this N1 experience. I bought this to compare it against Yogi Tea's \"Breathe Deep\" tea because of the lower cost.  It's pleasant enough but I prefer the Yogi Tea better.  This brand tastes good but seems to be less effective in clearing a cough or congestion than Yogi Tea. The taste of the breathe easy was ok, a little on the earthy side. I did find it cleared my lungs. However, I am prone to migraines and this set off a big one. I had to toss the 6 boxes I bought, ugh. I don't know about the medicinal aspects of this tea, but the flavor is downright scrumptious.  I love licorice root but have high blood pressure, so I'm not guzzling down box after box each week.  A few cups a week doesn't touch my BP, so I keep it to that.  The directions say to steep it for 10-15 minutes, but I'm far too impatient for that.  4-6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma.  Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas.  I just wish they weren't so proud of 'em.  ChaChing!  Thanks, TM. Now try to work on that pricing for us, will ya?  Danke. I love this tea, and it's my immediate go-to for congestion. Works better (for me) than DayQuil. I buy it by the case to keep from running out. It is the best natural way to relieve congestion of the sinuses. It has a mild sweet flavor and taken warm/hot sets great in the body. I have been using this for 2 years and now even my family use it, all very satisfied. I have this every night. The bags hold strong. The flavor is consistent box to box time to time. They stay fresh in the packaging. I'm going to make some right now. I use a lot of this tea when having breathing troubles.  It's not as effective as some prescription meds but does feel good and seems to help and also tastes good. I had TB when I lived in Mexico in l970/71/72.  I used eucalyptus/licorice tea and actually cured myself.  Since that time, I have used this tea every day as I love the taste of it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their lungs. For those of us with pulmonary conditions [e.g., asthma]  this tea is great!  And, as a tea lover, I have used it successfully  and enjoyed so doing. My husband has asthma. He uses peventative inhalers along with inhalers when an attack occurs. When the attack is severe he will go into the bathroom and turn the shower on hot, to inhale the steam.  Even doing all of this, the attack will continue until I prepare him the Breathe Easy Herbal Tea.  Within minutes after drinking the tea the asthma settles down. I ALWAYS carry a tea bag with me.  I never leave the house to go anywhere without the tea.  IT IS A LIFE SAVER!!!!!\n",
      "Even if you do not have asthma the tea will also help you breathe better with respiratory infections.  Just recently I had the flu for several weeks with much coughing the tea was AWESOME.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BREATHING AILMENT............. As soon as I take a sip or two I can feel a sort of wash and openness in my lungs.  Definitely causes one to \"breathe easy.\"  Have a hot tea or add a tea bag or two to your iced tea bags.  Very healthy stuff in there. Awesome candy, but it's nearly impossible for me to stop with one bag, LOL! I'll be buying these again, no doubt much sooner than I should need to. Whoppers Malted Milk Balls is one of my favorite candies. I like the 1.75 oz packages because it is the perfect size snack. Huuge Saving sent  it fast and  an excellent job. My whole family adores Whoppers and have for as long as I can remember. They're the perfect mix of malt and chocolate all in one little ball. What's not to like??\n",
      "\n",
      "The price here on Amazon saved me a small fortune on this batch, wish they have them on Subscribe and Save for this steal of a price...but I am happy to have gotten this deal even if not! Thanks, Amazon! What can you say about Whoppers Malt Balls except that they are whopping good.  I received my shipment on time and in perfect condition to give out on Halloween. Either you love them or you don't. I guess there's nothing in between. I love them. I love the malty taste in combination with the milk chocolate. One package is considered to be one serving size and just enough to be a perfect treat at no more than 220 calories per package. Good price Not as good as I remember.  The chocolate is rather underwhelming. There whoppers, cant mess that up. LOVE WHOPPERS AND WHAT A PRICE... Excellent Their a bit smaller in diameter than I remember,  but so are candy bars... the taste is satisfying and only one carton remains in the pantry. I love malted milk, whether it's in malted milk balls or on milk shakes. And of all the malted milk balls I've ever tried, WHOPPERS Malted Milk Balls are easily the worst quality, junk candies. For years they've had unacceptable numbers of duds; they've also been made of inferior ingredients, including hydrogenated oils and fats, which are horrible because trans-fats can't be properly digested by the human body. I'd love to see a candy company put out a decent brand of malted milk balls. Sadly, WHOPPERS are, in my view, not fit for human consumption. If you don't believe me, check out hydrogenated oils for yourself. But good malted milk balls will cost more, but hopefully you'll get what you pay for. Very fresh (BB date 09/2017).  A treat memory from childhood..what fun!  Good thing there are 6 containers because I think the first one may be gone in a couple of days.  Will need to put the rest out of sight (and hopefully out of mind!). It was a gift. They enjoyed them all. These candies did not taste fresh and the surface was not shiny as I have seen it when buying this product in the supermarket. They looked like they had been hanging around for quite a while even though the expiration date had not been reached. Because of the odd taste of the product, I threw them away. Won't buy them again on line. Purchased for my grandson-in-law in the Army overseas. Big Whopper house here.  Love these things.  Fantastic value. Good Kids loved it Always a great snack My favorite  and addictive,  I have never gotten in a stale box here they have always come fresh. I eat them faster than I can buy them Going back to the CRISPY M&Ms Love these! Great product for the price Product works great. Good product, Would purchase again. Delicious, and a good value... What more is to be said? After we ordered these we got some really hot days..I was expecting a melted clump..we were delighted to receive them packed securely cold and well insulated !...the whoppers are a link to childhood for us..totally awesome. Thanks Whenever I ordered chocolate in the past on some summer day it arrived a melted mess, Packaging HAS IMPROVED and this is my second order from amazon this summer for something chocolate which arrived in pristine condition. One of them came on the hottest day this year temperature approaching the hundreds, it was packed from every angle with cold packs and a huge pillowy cushion. The malted milk balls can't be beat they taste like I remember good ice cream from when I was a kid. Very fresh tasting all around delicious - there are a few recipes on the box but I like it as is. Ordered six (6) boxes as a gift. Five for a dear friend, one for me! Though the malted balls were smaller than I rememer they are the same melt in your mouth candy you had as a child. Received my order within a few days and the packing far exceeded my expectations. Would recommend. FYI: You can freeze Whoppers. Take them out of their container and put in a freezer bag. I put my freezer bag back into the waxed Whopper container for easier storage and to protect the candy from freezer burn. The candy did not clump into a solid mass. Will be ordering again. Been eating malted milk balls since my parents dropped off the kids at the movie theater on Saturday morning and tickets cosr $0.35. Arrived in good condition and so far all are fresh. They're frickin Whoppers! My teeth ache sometimes, but I gotta have one more! just like I remember as a kid My order was the freshest that I have ever had for Whoppers.  They are a fun product from my childhood memories.  They are very sweet, however.  I had been eating higher quality malt balls (from expensive chocolate stores) as an adult and the sweetness on these is a little overwhelming for me.  But, they were still fun and great to take to the movies.  If you like Whoppers, this was a great package at a great price. love it good These are some of my favorites. We like to munch of these while we watch movies on television. I bought some recently to use in a cookie recipe that sounded delicious but I waited too long to start baking. Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter. I was mad but as usual I got over it. I will try that recipe some other time. Whoppers are just too good to be left alone for any length of time at my house. They don't hang around very long at all. These are delicious, absolutely impossible to resist.  They never made it to the party they were intended for. I had to buy more. Good Price for an excellent treat. My family loves malted milk balls and gave everyone a carton for xmas how can you not love whopper? yum yum yum How do you not like whoopers. This was a great gag gift for a friend at Christmas that loves them. I was happy to find for a reasonable price and quantity, Been at least 10 years since I had these. Same great chocolate coating. They have removed some of the malt flavoring from the crunchy center. Good thing about that is, I won't be getting a sore tongue now if I happen to binge on these.\n",
      "Arrived in great shape.\n",
      "Best Used By date is 9/2015. as described. Easy to bake with. good buy on subscribe and save, always arrives as expected used for gift bags for my Sunday school kids at Easter.  Well received, of course.  Will buy again for sure. Love these whoppers originals, and it's so convenient to just go get another carton, when I empty one!  This is a favorite for the grandkids too. Arrived in very good condition, though freshness could be a little better. I like to mix these with cashews and almonds for a snack. I loved these as a kid and it's nice to see that they are still easily available to buy in stores or on the web. I don't often buy these but their malted milk chocolate flavor tastes similar to what I recall from my youth.\n",

      "I bought this directly from Amazon and it was packed well for shipping. The outer box was from Amazon and the inner sealed box contained the 12 cartons of Whoppers and had a date on the outside which I assume is the Sell By date or Expiration date. It is 9 months away and the candy tastes fine. These balls are great tasting candy. The aftertaste is great as well. These chocolate balls are tasting. Fully recommended. Five stars. I bought the Whoppers hoping to have them packaged in a container like the one pictured (like a milk carton),  They arrived in about a gazillion individually packed tiny bags.  (A pain in the A** to open.)  The whoppers themselves, however, where just like the ones I had as a kid.  Pretty dang good. Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper. STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE. We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church.  We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes.  I like how easy they are to use.  No mess, no tamping.  I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily. Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase. This is the dirtiest rock salt I've ever seen. Remember years ago when you opened up the rock salt, and it was white, and you could actually grab a piece and suck on it ..this isn't it !  This bag of salt looked like they'd swept it up off the busy New York streets after a long storm\n",
      "and then dried and bagged it. Like a friend said, \"Buy Morton, it's clean salt.\"  Think I'll do that next time. It's rock salt Made plenty of icecream What can one say about a bag of rock salt except to ask, (where is the home made ice cream?) Bought this salt along with an ice cream freezer and it worked just as expected. No problems. This is the first time that I've ever found real rocks in my rock salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take my ice cream ball to a friend's house so that our kids can play, and then we can have ice cream.  All goes well until I dump the salty water into her beautiful sink, and then I spend the next ten minutes apologizing and scraping little rocks and what looks suspiciously like bits of glass out of her garbage disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salt part all dissolved right on cue, but that stuff was certainly not all salt. I couldn't believe that I was right, but when I got home I checked and double checked the bag--yep, little rocks.  Maybe I got a bad bag?  Maybe it's supposed to be rocks and salt instead of rock salt?  All I know is I'll be picking a different brand next time I make ice cream. I really enjoyed this bar. It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed.  The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all.  Infact, I barely noticed it.  The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy.  I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat.  I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone. If you are looking for a flavorful treat to provide energy for a hectic lifestyle, the Berry Blast PowerBar Fruit Smoothie fits the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hesitant initially to give this one a try, having tasted a variety of other energy bars over the past few years, some good, some dreadful. I liked the sounds of this one and the fact it's made from real fruit with no additional sweeteners or artificial colors and flavors. So I decided to try it. I am glad I did. While I don't see this becoming a regular staple in my daily diet, it is great for the occasional pick-me-up when I am lagging on energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me. The texture takes some getting used to however. I wasn't quite sure what to expect so the taffy-like consistency was a surprise. Actually, that made it even better for me. I felt like I was indulging in a rare treat but without the guilt. I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did.\n",

      " Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2008. All rights reserved. I have always been a PowerBar fan. This the best I have ever had!! It has a very fruity flavor and was chewy, in a pleasing sort of way. It worked quite well as appetite suppressant. School is still out on it's \"energizing\" powers. The taste was great. Tasting and Texture Notes for Banana Flavor Power Bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.\n",

Of course, for specific information about whether this meets your dietary needs, consult a physician, dietician, and/or nutritionist. This is a great quality product and Amazon often saves me on the price. The original PowerBar in Chocolate has been a staple snack in my cupboards for over 20 years. I'm not an athlete, but enjoy a whole bar as an occasional meal replacement, or half a bar to push through the afternoon work day. With a large glass of water, they fill me up for hours and boost my energy level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste and consistentsy remind me of the Astronaut Sticks from the late 60s I enjoyed as a kid. (I admit, it's a weird 'comfort' food.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For newbies: the original PowerBar in Chocolate is chewy like a fresh tootsie roll, but not sweet, and definitely more filling. For those who love chocolate, but want to cut back on cane sugar, this is a great alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was part of a Pantry order, and the package arrived intact and fresh. excellent Son who is a collegiate runner loves them and with Prime I am able to ship direct to his dorm. Wonderful! thank you Will buy again Delicious and effective!\n",
      "\n",
      "Use these as a snack every time I'm on the trail! Banana is terrible. You can taste the crushed up vitamins and minerals more than the banana flavor. Wild Berry is delicious, the 2 stars are only for the banana. thanks These are the original style of the powerbars.  For some reason not many retailers stock this brand.  Tasty, filling and affordable.  Great for a lunch or snack on the run or when traveling.  When you buy them in bulk they are much less than in the store, when, as I said above, you can find them. as described quick ship. everything else aside - these are difficult to eat.  really not tasty and need something to wash it down.  do fill me up when i don't have a chance to eat properly though.  probably skip these in the future Really has a high level of sugar content -- actually causes a sugar high, then a downer. I use these for the movies.  I can't find them in the stores any more. Great tasting like candy but much better for you. These actually taste good. I was surprised. These are so tasty. What a great bargain! I'm not crazy about this chocolate flavor, but I highly recommend the peanut butter. These are delicious and definitely one of the better all-around tasting protein bars Ive had in a long time. Will be getting more soon. I keep power bars around for when I need a quick meal.\n",
      "I know some people don't like this taste, but I do.

Great product and love this flavor! I highly recommend! My favorite flavor for a meal on the go.  I use these for a boost between meals and the vitamins in them are great. These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish. Good try, but these taste too much like over-sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi-acrid aftertaste.  The Chocolates are the best, hands down.  This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added.  Very fake.  They are edible, but they are overpoweringly chemical. The only thing that taste better than the wild berry energy bars are the tropical tangy bars. This is a great PowerBar series. It's a shame that all the nutritional benefits of this bar went to waste on me because I couldn't even stomach the darn thing. It's literally just  a block of chewy mush with the sharpness of dark chocolate. There were even some random chunks of who knows what stuck in there. I've tried the creamy citrus flavor as well, and that I could at least get down. I am a lover of fruits. I enjoy preparing my own fruit shakes especially during the summer season. I am lucky because I have several relatives in the US which sends over a couple of the foods that they eat there, one of which is Power Bar Fruit Smoothie. They may have remembered me while they were enjoying this during their regular gym work-out. Thanks everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, its time for me to place my verdict. The taste is absolutely yummy. I can eat a dozen of these while watching my favorite television show but in terms of its energy boosting effects, I have to rethink again. It must be due to the sugar included in its ingredients but I did not feel any boosting effect at all. Unlike what my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements does for me. I am one of the few fortunate ones who is suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I sleep long hours yet feel tired and eat more yet feel hungry. It's a complicated condition but with my Gene Eden Vir 101 I manage to perform my daily tasks with ease. I could feel it effectively suppressing the growth of chronic viruses in my body thus giving me the added push to go on with may daily activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I took into consideration the taste and the price offered by the manufacturers and will still consider it a very great tasting snack. But for athletes, maybe they can find other power products that can stand true to its claim. This isn't really a PowerBar in the typical sense.  It's more of a thick smoothie-like fruit leather, if you can picture it.  It's all one consistency, meaning there's no coating, no filling.  Tastes like a smoothie but with a rubbery texture, so not that great, especially for an energy bar.  Doesn't seem filling enough to be 230 calories. I suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. I really don't know how I got this illness but I soon experience extreme exhaustion and weariness from work very often so I ended up asking the opinion of my physician. He informed me that I have active virus which eats up most of my energy so I end up tired and confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system. I am recovering fairly well after taking Gene Eden as my regular supplement but I wanted to perform the previous activities I enjoyed doing like regular gym work-outs and long walks in the park. Ever since I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome I was limited by my doctor to do strenous activities but with the aid of Gene Eden I feel long lasting boosting energy flowing through my blood stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to combine Power Bar with one of my walks in the park and I was amazed how it kept my energy level high. I believe the electrolytes contained in these energy bar is sufficient to keep the cells of my body going.\n",

      "I plan to do an hour of aerobic routine next week and is optimistic that both Power Bar and Gene Eden will not fail me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much for giving me a chance to live my previous life once again. I just hope eating much of Power bar won't make me fat in any way. These particular power bars are very hard to find in my area of the country.  I like the flavor of these power bars over the  many kinds of power bars that contain mainly chocolate. You need a magic tonic to help you recover following a new personal best?  Good luck funding one.\n",

      "However, if you want a well-packaged, carb-rich bar that won't melt in your hands, that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45-60 minutes, then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonfat chocolate milk might work just as well, but it certainly won't last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack's side pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Know what you are getting, and use it appropriately.  Then you won't be disappointed! I've always liked power bars even when they did NOT taste so good.  I'd take them on the trail with me while hiking or when riding my bike.  They are compact and packed full of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that Power Bar has gotten better and better at improving the flavor and texture of their bars!\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this one.  You won't be disappointed. I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted \"like vitamins\", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar. I expected this to have a sweet, smooth taste, like the fruit blend drink. Instead I found a sharp, not quite unpleasant aftertaste as the dominating flavor.  This was not something I would choose. The flavor wasn't very good, the texture was a little too grainy, and the aftertaste just bordering on bad.  For people who crave smoothies, this is no substitute. This is basically a hunk of quick carbs with some electrolytes and other additives.  It WAS tasty, but does it really do anyting more for you than an ordinary candy-bar? I'm not convinced on that one. This bar may well provide a bit of quick energy, but I found the taste achingly sweet. Too bad, because if it were a bit more tart and a lot less sweet,  it might be quite pleasant. This bar was a pleasant surprise.  The flavor was subtle and the taffy consistancy was a surprise but overall tasty! First off this bar is much moister than PowerBar's that I have tried in the past; so much so, that when I held vertical, it would bend one way or the other until the top when past horizontal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But moisture alone does not make a good energy bar. The Fruit Smoothie PowerBar isn't bad per se, but it is not very good. It is sweet, but it doesn't really taste much like a fruit smoothie, especially not a smoothie from the likes of Jamba Juice. It is just kinda of sweet and pliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend one try the Odwalla bars instead, they are much better tasting and they are like eating food, not something out of Soylent Green. I didn't get up and sprint around the blocl after I ate this bar so I'm not sure as to how much energy it actually provided but it hate a good fruity taste and was about the right size for a quick snack. The bar was quite chewy but that did not distract from it's enjoyment. Would certainly try this product again. Power Bar Fruit Smoothie, Berry Blast\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the flavor of this bar, but, the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein. If it had less sugar and more protein, I'd recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gunner  June, 2008 Power bars in general are very soft and chewy. They're not my favorite, but they are not bad. This one has a strong fruity flavor, similiar to taffy. The \"vitamin flavor\" is noticeable, but not horrendously strong. This is a good choice for an occasional snack on the go. Power bars keep well in the car and if they get too mushy due to heat, they recover well when cool again. It's surprisingly very tasty, but I recommend eating only half at a time.  It's pretty good out of the fridge and once it has thawed just a little.  If you eat the whole bar in one setting, it's a bit much with the fruity flavor.  But half of it?  Excellent! First immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar. As an athlete, I have used Power Bar products for years.  I have to say this is one of the better tasting Bars.  Has a definite strawberry flavor, without being too sweet.  If you haven't ever had a Power Bar, then you may be surprised at the texture.  These are not candy bars!  They provide a great energy boost when you don't have time for a full meal.  Excellent for slipping in your bike jersey pocket for eating on the road.  Highly recommended. Me, I'm generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I don't look at them as \"power bars,\" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.\n",
      "\n",
      "PowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (\"Berry Blast\" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a \"fruity gum\" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this \"fruit smoothie\" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating\" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.\n",

      "FOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.\n",
      "\n",
      " Just throw some in your gym bag.  You're good to go! I found this bar to be labeled wrong. It should of been SuperSweet Fruit Smoothy. 24g sugar, 42g carb and only 6g protein. The smoothy I make in my blender is quick and healthy using a protein mix with fresh or frozen fruit. Cannot see myself ever purchasing this. Did not like the candy taste and with such little protein, is not a healthy on the go bar. There are many healthier bar choices for a quick energizing snack. Thumbs down. This was a pretty good energy bar.  The taste was good.  I did notice a energy boost and it was not too high in sugars etc.  Overall, a pretty good product. I tried this Powerbar with another person.  We both were not pleased with the taste.  We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste, we didn't think we'd ever want another One!  I don't think we are going to finish this bar.  Not the best I've ever tasted and I would never buy this again! A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go...... who always has time for a sit down breakfast? ... Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD ! It wasn't too bad, but was just too sweet for my wife's taste (I ended up not being able to try it, because it turned out to not be gluten free - which I need). Work great for bath bombs. Shiploed fast. Great quality. As described cup cake fun time for the grand kids Price WAY too high for what you get, and due to static cling, can't even get them all out, over half stick to the inside of the already ridiculously TINY little compartment! Great assortment and very fun for kids to use when decorating cookies or cupcakes. my daughter loves candy she would go crazy eating every candy and flavors she see it great for decorating. great thanks Bright and colorful. Hard to get out of container. The non-pareils were static clinging to the inside walls of the container. Kids love them ! Don't get excited by these! The section of the container that holds the sprinkles is only about one inch high!  You won't get many uses out of this if you are preparing a lot of cupcakes! Kids loved decorating with these. Great colors These are really cute sprinkles.  Will be cute on whatever you put them on. Expire? Mine's even better: no expiration or manufactured date! And the taste is horrible, almost starchy. They're cute alright but I will be returning them. Lots of average okay colors mixed in okay shapes that were okay to use for what they were intended. Nice, handy and very colorful. We sprinkle just a few on our cupcakes. Always adds that special touch. Will keep on hand. Nice not to have to fool with six different containers. Little lids open easily and close securely. Good product. Maybe just a tad bit overpriced. Yum I had to buy another of these. I let my grand kids use them for their mud pies. Perfect for kids to decorate cupcakes etc. I bought these for my granddaughter who loves to bake.  She was very pleased. I have a huge collection of sprinkles.  I wanted to use some today and was surprised to find I hadn't even opened this particular assortment (the animals and stars one, since there are multiple items on the same page), so of course these were the ones I had to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think these are really cute.  I used the stars on some chocolate cupcakes today but am now trying really hard to think of something to do with the cows.  The picture on the item page is an accurate reflection of what you'll get and is also fairly reflective of the size.\n",
      "\n",
      "These taste vaguely sugary and have a lot of artificial colors in them.  I figure, you're only using a small amount on any one baked item, so it won't hurt me to consume small quantities.  My experience is that, if you plan to store your baked goods for more than a couple of days, the color does start to bleed out (while I hadn't opened this assortment, I had a different Wilton assortment with similar ingredients that I'd experienced this with), especially with light-colored frostings.  (I always make my own frosting with butter, powdered sugar, and milk.  I can't say for sure that the bleeding color would happen in canned frosting.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These don't necessarily distribute evenly because the shapes are rather large and tend to clog up the holes in the shaker.  If this happens, just turn the shaker right side up again and bang it on the counter and you should be good to go.  On one batch of 12 cupcakes, I used about 1/3 of the stars.  So you should be able to get at least a couple of uses out of each shape, making these well worth the cost. Excellent! I ordered this product and came to me like the picture and details said about this product. It has 6 different variety of sprinkles. The price was fair for this and mine wasn't expired like the other said. I feel bad for them because that was unfair for them. I hope your order comes out good when you order this but if you are precautious person then don't buy it. Go to the store and buy it for yourself. It is your choice. The taste was okay to be honest. Most all Wilton sprinkles are okay; they aren't the best taste. How can anyone complain about sprinkles?  This variety pack was a little on the small side, but came with a lot of cute colors and shapes. These just make frosted cupcakes look so darn yummy! Can't wait to mix up a batch and add the sprinkles. I liked the shapes that are included, so was as expected. It was a bit smaller than the other 6 sprinkle mixes that I have purchased locally. I haven't had a chance to use these yet but I love the bold bright colors. Container was larger than I expected. Sprinkles for all occasions. Granddaughters enjoy using these on their cake pops. Nice assortment of sprinkles for various baking needs. Got these for my first try at Momofuku's birthday cake - Success!  I was really pleased at how colorful they were and how well they were incorporated into the final baked cake.  Will buy again! The packaging was good and arrival time was earlier than expected.  The colors are bright and fun and the sprinkles were fresh and not stale like some can be.  They made my Christmas cookies extra special. I bought these for making pop cakes, but the product is so versatile for color themes and various holidays to decorate cake batters, cookies and dough or if you are really messy, for making pictures on a slice of toast. LOL. Such a minute amount--not worth the money. And, the opening is a nuisance--needs an option to pour,too. Horrible for cake pops! Icing is dry before you can shake them on pop. Perfect Sprinkle Assortment for the price & it comes in a nice little shaker. I'm pleased with this product & will order this exact assortment or a similar item again. I ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter.  What I got was a GARISH collection of these that were FAR TOO UGLY to use on anything.  I do not recommend these to anyone. They do not match up to the picture shown.  Shame on Wilton for even making what they sent me. I bought these sprinkles for my wife as a stocking stuffer gift! Great idea by the way, fit wonderfully in her stocking. She tends to be a sprinkle nut and really enjoys sprinkles on cakes and cookies, and can't get enough! Anyway this set is great, and comes in a soup can sized container with all 6 types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for 4 stars, is because this is a great product, but in the shipping process some of the sprinkles were broken. If you are ok with losing a few in the shipping process, it's definitely something to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this for a kids party or a sprinkles nut like my wife! very convenient and practical to have all those sprinkle in one place, it when on easy and that we like when you are cooking with kids Not too much you can say about this.  A fun pack of sprinkles for the children to make their cupcakes and muffins. Color is very weak.  Doesn't really help Wilton Candy melts color which are already dim.  Won't buy again. Stains your skin really bad! The colors are not accurate. I didn't get patriotic red and blue, I got a funny shade of pink and teal blue. It also is just a jar and not a dropper so it's extremely messy. The jars are pretty little. Not a fan of these at all! I needed something that would allow me to dye mineral oil without having the color separate out, and this works very well.  Don't make the mistake I made the first time - I used too much, and that results in a cloudy color.  Just start with a drop, and take it from there.  With the primary colors, you can make almost any other color you need.  It comes with Blue, Red, Orange & Yellow - but you can make Green and Purple as well by mixing. Red did not mix well to make hard candies, disappointed Works really well with chocolate, hoping they can come out with more colors. Very nice, used these in conditioner to make a natural toner. Worked perfectly Worked for us. Exactly what I wanted As expected. I used this to color mineral oil for sensory bottles. Worked great! This project is PERFECT for coloring melted chocolate because it is NOT water based.  I want more colors !  Great product! These are much better than the colors they sell in the grocery store.  More vivd I'm 100% against serving anything with candy melts between the flavor (ick!) and the palm kernel oil so I bought this hoping to color white chocolate for a project. It works, sort of, but it took so much of the product to get a decent color that my chocolate was too soft to set in the molds. I made three separate attempts just to make sure I hadn't overheated my chocolate or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this product is better suited for candy melts and at that point, you might as well buy the pre-colored variety rather than having to dye them yourself. I did end up using some of this in a buttercream frosting when I ran out of my normal gel color and it seemed ok for that too. Colored my white chocolate perfectly. I used it to make cake pops These work for coloring white chocolate but you need a lot of it to color things vibrantly. I love using these colors to dye my white candy melts! It works really well with the merckens brand that I use to make my cakepops. My only issue with it is that it does not have a drip top. I poked two little holes in the foil, one for the dye to drop out of and one for air to come in for air flow. That way, I don't have to take the foil off completely, which cause a mess. We used this to dye oils for a science and toddler projects.  So far we have only used it with baby oil, mineral oil, etc.  But we intend to dye other oil-based substances to make a rainbow in a bottle real soon = )\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that where the water-based and oil-based substances meet - there is a yellow line forming against the plastic bottles.... in other words, the dye appears to be staining the bottle itself or precipitating out of solution? I tried to use these to change the color of white chocolate. I didn't think about mixing the black with the white chocolate. I wanted black chocolate since I couldn't find any color melts but obviously white & black mixed makes grey. There was no amount I could add that would create black which was disappointing but understandable. Just wanted to put that out there for anyone else who wasn't thinking about that like I was. The other colors paired beautifully & the chocolate still tasted the same to me. 1. The caps are not very secure and I've had a mess in my dye box a couple times due to not screwing them on as tightly as possible. Learn from my mistake, otherwise you'll have a HUGE mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Give me more dye!! Why do these little containers have to be so stinkin' small? I can use almost an entire color for one single order.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Make this into a squeeze bottle or some kind of dropper! It would be 10x more convenient. Used these as oil dye for oil lamps.  Pretty colors.  Doesn't take too much dye to color a candle. thank you The amount you get is very small. Works OK. Love this product. Waiting for a long time, but the goods is very satisfied. I think I will buy again. works well I have used this twice for my hard tack candy and it does not \"dispurse\". It does NOT blend at all in the boiling state. Hopefully will work when melting chocolate. Good. Ok Product seemed like it was maybe old, been sitting on a shelf too long... the 1st box I was sent was partially open and leaked all over. It appeared that the foam seals were opened and the lids were not on tight- what a mess.\n",
      "But Amazon sent me a new box and they are perfect! they color my white chocolate without making it seize. the colors are lighted then you might want- the red is hot pink. But I was coloring white chocolate so it makes sense. I have never gotten true colors from dye, if I need red, black or brown I just buy candy melts.\n",
      "They mixed ok. I was trying to get purple and it turned out a little gray, and green was dull. So I guess I better buy those color dyes and not try to mix. . Thanks I HATE the Wilton colored chocolate (sorry Wilton).  I use these colors in Merckens and the colors come out vibrant, and with the high quality of the Merckens wafers, the colors are evenly mixed in the chocolate. This is exactly what you can purchase in a store. It cost a little more but being that the store I would purchase this from {crafts 2000\n",
      "} was always out I had no choice but purchase here. This is good option for people needing to use a lot of color. Didn't blend into the hard candy mix as it should have.  I'm new to making candy, so it might have been my fault.  But I made 4 or 5 batches and had same problem.  I switched to Ateco and I am happier. These colors are bold and bright!  They are very high quality and work very well when making hard candy! I would recommend these. Love this product I was having so much trouble with my chocolate freezing up when I would try to color it for decoration.  This product works great the colors are really clear and not muddled. I use these with my melting chocolate and they work great!! All 4 colors were as described. I didn't have problems with colors spilling like another reviewer did. This is a pretty good product i got them about a week ago and already i have to order more. My only problem with this product is it's size. I wish they made them bigger. It actually saves me from having to buy chocolate melts in every color i can just buy white and use the candy color. My mom used this frosting on my sisters wedding cake and I thought it was amazing...even better than the icing on my pastry chef made wedding cake!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised to see bad reviews for this frosting because I love it so much that I changed my own frosting recipe to mimic it. It's a heavier frosting, but lighter (weight/sweetness-wise, I have no idea if it has less or more calories) than pure buttercream frosting feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed the bad reviews and had to redeem this frosting. I really liked this frosting and quite a few people at my sisters wedding did as well. This is not like regular canned icing. It is made for decorating with a bag and tips. It is a lot stiffer and hard to apply if you are planning on using it as a spread icing. Tasted good but tore up the cake a little. There are better tasting products on the market but this white icing is okay. Tastes better on something than straight out of the can. It's stiff so it's good for making flowers etc. but can easily be made more spreadable by just stirring in a little water. great Way overpriced on Amazon!  I bought the same container at Walmart for $2.74!  Anyway, I bought this for a \"mommy and me\" cupcake decorating class.  I don't know why anyone would recommend this icing except for last minute ease of use if you did not have time make your own.  It is super sweet and ridiculously stiff, which serves its purpose if thats what your looking for.  However, many of the Wilson tips (a large range of sizes) that we used in class were too small to properly push the icing out without tremendous force.  I had difficulty.  It was impossible for my eight year old.  The icing seemed suited only for the 2 largest tips.  My classmates were inquiring about a more \"workable\" icing than this.  We were told to Youtube it since better icing exists.  I guess for something quick and cheap (if purchased elsewhere), it was ok.  For 10 bucks, no way!! i'm amazed how great this tastes. we bought it to go with the wilton colors Mice I love this product.  It's always consistently good and so convenient.  Stir it up before you use it.  It's easy to use! This came in a plastic tube and made me sick to my stomach. It tastes so bad i threw it out immediately, and then threw up. Amazon sucks for selling this crap. This icing is not meant for spreading over a whole cake. It's very stiff icing for making flowers and other decorations. The icing that comes in the 4.5lb tub is for covering the cake. I recommend not buying from Amazon though. The same product is half that price at WalMart. They put it back with the wedding stuff and crafts. You can also get it cheaper at Hobby Lobby, Michael's, etc. The dark chocolate ones surpass all other flavors we've tried.  They're decadently delicious.  You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price, given that shipping is free with Prime membership.  What a great deal! It was OK, was expecting a milder flavor. These are NOT sweet at all, which I like. These are a great way to eat Dr. recommended dark chocolate.  The wafer is light, crisp and lets the chocolate flavor shine. And they stay fresh and whole in the tins. :) great good value Excellent Piroulines arrived when promised and, as yet,  I haven't encountered any broken ones. Each rolled wafer is a perfect combination of textures: you encounter a crisp but not crumbly sheath of dough filled with creamy hazelnut chocolate. Piroulines are a perfect go-with any after dinner service: sorbets, ice creams, berries, gelato. Of all the flavors offered by Pirouline, this Dark Chocolate is my all-time favorite.  Not too sweet, crispy exterior with a fudgy interior -- really nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Like others, my shipment of six 14-oz canisters arrived with some breakage and crumbling.  So far, I've used 4 of the 6 cans, each containing 2 foil-wrapped sleeves (so I've opened 8 sleeves so far).  I've had 3 sleeves with NO breakage at all -- every one completely intact with just a tiny bit of crumbling on an end here and there.  The other 5 sleeves contained some broken cookies -- ranging from 20% to probably 60% of the contents.  Since I purchased these for my own use, this isn't a problem.  The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones. :-)  So far, I've had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents.  But if you're looking for perfect presentation, bear in mind that you're probably going to have to deal with some breakage.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I'll purchase these again.  The price is comparable to my local supermarket, and having it delivered is a convenience I'm willing to pay a bit extra for.  The dark chocolate flavor is divine -- definitely 5-star worthy in my book. I love these things even though I'm not really hooked on sweet stuff. I read some reviews on how a lot of the contents were broken up during shipment. Even though, in my case...it wasn't really a big deal, mine were the same as most....about 40% broken in each can I've opened so-far. Just using these personally, not for show, so....it's really not an issue for me. Other than that, they are good for when you do get the yearning for something sweet. too crumbly These are AMAZING!!! Rich dark chocolate, thin wafer crust. I just love them and so does the wife. Almost an addiction by now :). Belongs in my yummy field. Note that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are complaints about sellers and shippers.  These delicious Belgian cookies are baked in Mississippi by DeBeukelaer, a company which traces its roots to 1860.  They are light, crisp, delicate and made with quality ingredients.  The dark chocolate are my favorite and the one I recommend to chocoholics. Delicious, however many were broken in transit so I did not give them as gifts. I will manage to eat them myself. Yum !! What's not to love? Dark chocolate + easy and fun to eat! (I sometimes pretend to hold them like cigars.) These are available in sealed tins in different sizes.  They are sometimes available in stores, but the Amazon price, per ounce, is somewhat lower than what I have found in stores.  The ones I have purchased have internal foil wraps for added protection.  They can be somewhat fragile if mishandled (that may depend on your local shipper).  They are suitable for serving with coffee or tea for various social events.  The tines have a best buy date shown on the bottom of the tin. Everyone loves these wafers. My sister-in-law introduced me to these wafers and I was hooked immediately, enough that I continue to keep them on hand (thanks to Amazon's subscribe and save). A couple of these will satisfy your sweet tooth. The hard part is trying not to eat the whole can!\n",
      "Love the texture and taste. Great product. I ordered the case and when I opened the first can they were all broken up, I thought maybe it was just that can, but no they were all broken into small pieces, I mean every can into small pieces. I cancelled My subscription, I was so disappointed. The entire batch of wafers were beat up, even the tins! More crumbs and pieces than expected whole wafers. The shipping & packaging boxes themselves were in pristine condition. I'm believing these were packed as seconds for sale at reduced prices. I like to reuse tins to store odds & ends and the lids were not fitting due to bashed tins & lids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchase locally and save yourself the disappointment! I used to have these as a kid... they do not taste the same at all. Quite terrible to be honest and now im stuck with 6!!! Eww. i love that they're dark chocolate! i found these once in a fresh market store but not since then. but i was gladdened to find them online. i have one with breakfast every day and oddly they seem to cut down on my overall craving for other chocolate. which is helpful. : > The DeBeukelaer family has been making Belgium biscuits in The United States since 1860.\n",

      "Pirouline is the only national brand of rolled wafers actually made in America. One bite and you'll understand why these delicious and light snacks can be very addicting.\n",

      "The biscuit layer is light and flaky and the hazelnut chocolate inside makes for delicious snacking.\n",

      "They come in a tall, slender, 3.25 ounce tin and the tins are great for storing pasta or writing instruments afterwords. Highly recommended. I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines. They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated. They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale. Sorry. The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT!! so, I don't know what happened. I'll try again when they have more. Accurately described - good value - fast shipping - WEAK paper wall sugar canisters - canister not as durable as the OLD DIXIE sugar canisters - if you use lots of sugar, you will use up the sugar before the container falls apart. It's sugar, what can I say?! One of the three cannisters came broken so all of the contents were rendered useless. Good product, the sugar hardens quick one the package is opened. loved it It tastes great! We had a problem with rough handling during shipping (I guess) and several broke.  But it was quickly resolved by the supplier and I am happy.  I also like the giant container which comes with a pump and can sit on the counter. I eventually decided to purchase the nestle French vanilla twenty four single serving quantity pack (24 3/8 oz or 11 ml creamers totaling 9 ounces)after seeing it enough times at the cereal section of my job. The French vanilla creamers  have a delectable taste and go perfectly with the swiss miss milk chocolate hot cocoa and the nestle rich milk chocolate cocoas. Amazon, would you please change this stupid word count requirement to leave reviews? IT'S CREAMER...it was good. I'm a't come up with a paragraph about creamer! I shop Amazon a LOT, but rarely leave a review, because of this requirement. Ok,nonsense now, so I will have enough words:\n",
      " Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada To me this is just a plain, old creamer.  I'd prefer something with a little spunk in it. So perfect and easy at the office! Guess I forgot about  the 'non-dairy' creamer definition.  my mistake - I have to be careful in the future. Not sweet enough. I have to use three (75 calories) to get the sweetness I like in my coffee. I have opted for another sweeter brand so I can use fewer units to save on calories and plastic waste. This was my second time ordering these. Definitely worth buying. Great taste and great price. This box had some spilled in it, but I was refunded and I plan to purchase again. great great good Little pricy since so small u nees 3-4 per cup, or at least i do These creamers are ideal to have in an office for coffee first thing in the morning. The box is perforated and sturdy so it is easy to open and the creamers come out without a hassle. The plastic  covers on the creamers pull off with little difficulty.\n",
      "I highly recommend these creamers for the office and those who like French Vanilla flavor and are lactose intolerant. Great taste and arrived without any damage whatsoever. I love these creamers! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge (not necessary but I do) and just take out what you need. The price is the best here on Amazon, I first purchased these from another site and paid $2.00 more! I'll be back for more. Can't make the coffee strong enough. I'm sure it's good if you like mellow coffee, but I'm Cajun and grew up on very strong coffee. Will not buy this again. I first had this coffee while visiting The Netherlands and was elated to find it here on Amazon! This was a good coffee with pretty good natural sweetness and good body,  you could barely taste the bit of the astringency (like coffee here in the states seem to have).  Tasty enough to drink black (no sugar nor creamer needed). It also doesn't have that \"oily\" residue that other coffee has. Nice overall flavor! Very expensive for what you get...but it was good. Best of the Douse Egberts Tasted terrible. My number one coffee Good coffee Nothing to write home about. Expensive, and not as good as 8 O'clock Columbian that's 1/4 the price. I would not buy this again, and sorry I bought it this time. Not a very good value. Now, I'm waiting for my Cool Brew liquid coffee to arrive. liked the first blend I bought better it was a medium roast. good coffee Really good coffee but is costly. This is some of the best coffee I've ever had, and I've had a lot of average, fancy and expensive kinds.  I was in a restaurant and had this coffee, it was so good I asked the waitress if she could fine out what kind it was.  She wrote it down for me and told me they get asked all the time.  It's so smooth and such a delightful flavor.  I love it!!! VERY GOOD Nothing like the restaurant brew I was looking for. Found this at a hospital. Taste great. Good, but a stronger blend would probably be better. I got this for someone who had it at a restaurant and lived it. It's very smooth! I personally like flavored, organic coffee better. A bit disappointing. Though is is good, it doesn't taste like the coffee that the restaurant serve. Great coffee More of a hassle than K-cups, but the coffee is good. Wished they carried DE in K-cups. Taste is OK, but no aroma. The expiry date is Jan 15, 2015. I ordered this just a few weeks ago, so this is very out of date coffee they are supplying! Will try coffee tomorrow and report further. Very strong coffee but I like the flavor. Need to add cream because it's too strong for me but I don't even mind My wife and I both enjoy the flavor ...we'd been having coffee shipped from Hawaii and found this to be a much better tasting coffee for about the same cost ...We don't drink anything now but this and it's decaffeinated companion. Great coffee I love the taste of this coffee. It brings back memories of my trips to Europe and Asia. And the price on Amazon is cheaper than most \"high-end\" coffees in my local grocery store. great taste Great flavor.  I tried this coffee based on the high ratings it received and I was not let down.  I'll be back again to order more. Thanks Douwe voor de geweldige smaak! I will go with other brands. Not my type of coffee. Just okay My friends had us over and served us this coffee.  I had to come home and order it right away.  It is smooth, great tasting, and I highly recommend it. Great coffee, I brew it in my Bunn coffeemaker.  I think I'll have a cup right now. This is the same brand served in one of our nearby casinos, but hard to find.  Good coffee. The best drip coffee I have found.  I have been drinking it for several years now, even while straying off to try other brands.  I keep comming back to this for a smooth cup of morning warmth. I was curious to try this, believe it or not, after seeing this product being served to patrons of a casino which I visited. I love coffee and will try any brand at any time, even though I am fairly loyal to another brand. This was available at a decent price with free prime. Not bad at all even for what I paid. I'd likely purchase it again if what I do use ever became unavailable. My husband and I were so disappointed with the flavor of this Aroma Rood blend. We love the Douwe Egderts Pure Gold Coffee. But this we awful and we dumped the whole can into our compost pile. We ate at Cheddars and fell in love with the coffee!...very rich, deep, robust flavor....I asked what brand...since  then, I have been trying to find the Douwe Egberts that mimics the coffe we drink at Cheddars.  I have not found it yet!  It was recommended that we try the Columbian D. E.  I have tried that, it is closer but stil no cigar....  This brand is far too expensive to buy for a generic cup of coffee.  I can get that from Folgers which is what my husband thought he was drinking.  I say, save your money.  Although it is good, it is not great. Classic bubble gum flavor with a subtle mix of mint. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two every time. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.\n",

It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States. tastes good Tasty, mild, but not long lasting taste Good taste, for about 5 seconds.  After 10, you are just exercising your jaw, tasteless. Great price on orbit chewing gum. I don't know why but I found it difficult to find sweet mint in the store now. Also for denture and partial wearers this does not seem to stick to dental work. Tasty My spouse's favorite gum.  I don't chew it because I don't eat gelatin but he won't chew anything else. I'm not a fan of peppermint. It's too strong. Sweet mint has that perfect fresh taste while also having a flavor just sweet enough to actually enjoy chewing it. My husband chews this to curb his sweet addictions Absolute favorite flavor.  Good price here on Amazon too. Pretty good Price Loved this gum but something has changed. Doesnt hold its flavor very long anymore. This gum is tasty and a great deal! great deal, arrived quickly Unfortunately, mine was stale as well. However, the taste was OK and it wasn't too expensive, so I'm not too upset, but next time I'll buy it at the grocery store. Tasted like rubber, zero mint flavor, broken in particles within 10 minutes of chewing. The only gum I chew.  It is, what it is.  What can you say about gum. I would not survive without this gum.  It satisfies my sweet tooth while keeping me from eating stuff I don't need.  I really enjoy this gum. Great buy While you're chewing it, everything's great. It's fresh, it feels good, and you wish it could go on like that forever. Then it reaches a point where it loses it's appeal completely and you spit it out in disgust, hoping to never, EVER see it again, discarding it like a used up tissue. Love this gum. Great, long-lasting flavor. This is my favorite gum flavor. very tasty. Such a reliably delicious flavor. Order, order, order! Love, love Orbit fruit flavored gum. This is a great value My favorite gum! not too strong but gets the job done and lasts a long time! amazing deal Minty, did its job I found I was buying this at the grocery store frequently and decided it would be more cost effective to buy this large package on Amazon.  Wonderful idea! A favorite flavor Very nice, tastes great Superior mint flavor that lasts a long time. this is good! Grandson love them as expected Great Product! My favorite gum, and this isn't a bad price. My daughter and her boyfriend both really like this gum, won't chew anyother AWESOME PRODUCT Great! Only place I've been able to find this flavor. Fresh. No issue Great product! GREAT GUM...PLEASED ED Tastes like jello Best flavor. Not too minty and not disgustingly sweet. Love cinnamon gum! Only gum we chew, only buy on Amazon. Great price. Prefer the spearmint. I love Orbit and this is my favorite flavor. I like that you get a ton of gum in this package. I would definitely recommend it. The flavor of this gum is so good that I always buy it from Amazon in bulk!!  I've been buying this from Amazon for the last 3 years and I still love the flavor! Excellent product Great gum, even better value! it's gum, good price. Gum last and gets me through the day. Good flavor for sugar free and low sodium too.

This gum is great love this gum... Great Price. Fast Shipping. LOVE THIS SUGAR FREE GUM Good purchase I am addicted to this Bubblemint gum! Khan Lee is Awesome. Tastes good and is refreshing just like it supposed to . We love orbit gum and love this car case for it. It's a lot of gum, y'all. Bought these in bulk for my girlfriend. Tired of spending more $ at target for them :) My mouth waters just thinking about this flavor! The flavor only lasts a few minutes sadly, but I only really chew gum for something to chew on, and also to make my breath smell great. This gum gives your breath a very powerful strawberry smell, really great. My son loves this stuff. Flavor is great! My kids love knowing mom always has gum available now :) It taste like its suppose to. Not very flavor able The best price you could ever get, Fresh made (not expired or not even close to expiry date), original neat whole pack that you couldn't buy from stores on this price. Orbit have had the best quality since beginning. Do not hesitate to get advantage of this great price deal of the best Sugar Free Gum. great value for a 24 pack Better than expected. MMMM Tasty Gum great flavor loved the price for this I love this stuff.  I smoke, and this helps promote saliva production to keep my mouth healthy, and my breath fresh. What is there to review/say?  Like broccoli or opera, one either loves or hates it.  I love Orbit gum.\n",

The bottle was busted & only a couple of pieces were on the bottom of the box.  Must be a trail of gum from here to where ever the gum came from This is a really nice warm minty flavor.  Its Mild Flavor.  Though, some people like a really strong minty flavor that helps people with what they feel may be their own bad halitosis.  LOL!\n",

      "If you found this review helpful.  Please click Yes at the bottom of this review.  Thank You. Tastes and smells great! Sometimes the Strawberry flavor is hard to find but not on Amazon! One of the only flavors I chew. Love them! Doesn't last as long as I thought it would but it's okay. We've tried all the varieties of Orbit gum but always come back to the Bubblemint Sugarfree in the familiar pink package. It's a traditional flavor; nothing gimmicky, has long-lasting chewiness (I'll keep it in for about 30 minutes) and most importantly, doesn't leave my teeth feeling icky or bitty. Amazon has the best price I've found, and when you use Subscribe & Save it's even cheaper! now I have acquired the cinnamon penchant Tastes Great! I've been sampling a variety of different chewing gums so far, and I'd say this is my favorite. Sweet, with a nice texture. Flavor isn't terribly long-lasting, but no worse than other gums I've tried. I'll definitely buy again. This strawberry flavor tastes very phony and kinda weird. My favorite flavor of Orbit gum is the Tropical Remix. None of these gums' flavors lasts more than about 6-7 minutes at most. Caution: the more pieces you chew the more gas you will pass (I mean severe). And if you chew 2 entire packages within a day, you'll probably get diahrrea like I did!!! All of the Orbit gums are bubble gums which I like but the pieces are rather small so I chew 2-3 pieces at a time. Love this gum and in the pantry a good price The flavor is powerful and seems to last! Nobody else makes this flavor - hark back to bubblegum of old. Excellent.  Fresh! Good lasting flavor and priced right with Amazon Pantry. Always keep these handy.  sugar free best gum around.  bubble mint rocks. Great product! one of the few cinnamon flavored sugarfree gums that last in flavor for more then a few minutes. I liked the flavor This is a great but on subscribe and save and pmuch cheaper than I can find in the store.  Flavor doesn't last that long but it is great while it does.  I keep the entire desk on my desk at work and take a pack when I go to meetings and leave on the table for the group.  It is usually gone by the end of the meeting. Best cinnamon gum bar none!! Always fresh-tasting, never disappoints! The flavor is tastes good, but it doesn't last. Good price and free shipping. This is NOT BUBBLE-GUM...\n",
      "This is only flavored like it.\n",
      "YOU CAN'T BLOW BUBBLES with IT, not even one tiny one!!! Omnomnomnom...this is so deliciously tasty I have to refrain from eating more than one piece at a time. Tastes like the old pink bubblegum we used to get with trading cards. no complaints tasted great and lasted a nice amount of time..Worth the purchase.. Fresh! My wife's favorite My entire family likes the Wintermint flavor. Buying it by the case saves money, especially when I purchase through Amazon's subscribe and save program.\n",

      "Orbit gum has a nice long-lasting flavor. I would highly recommend. best gum there is, will buy these forever Sweet and bubble gummy and not overly minty.  I keep a cup in the car all the time and it takes away my craving for sweets and freshens my breath without smelling like mouthwash. Nice flavor This is a great price for gum. I love it makes my mouth dry,flavor is good.will not buy again. Long lasting mint flavor with a touch of bubble gum flavoring.  very unique taste. Great price compared to individual packs.  Handy to keep in the desk drawer without damaging the gum.  Also a plus, it is one of the few gums available that I haven't had a problem with it sticking to dental work!  That makes it #1 in my book.  FYI...Orbit Watermelon flavor also does not stick to dental work No issues... Great flavor! Good wat to buy. I don't only enjoy the flavor but also the price that is offer for. Had ordered more than once. According to my dentist I should chew more gun, especially in between meals when brushing may not be possible. But I didn't want a sugary offering; sugar-free is the way to go.  And Orbit from Wrigley, offers up the best price /taste combination. While the flavor does not last nearly as long as I'd like (wouldn't we all want it to last and hour or so), I still enjoy the brand and it's plethora of flavor offerings. The gum has an amazing strawberry flavor, but it does not last very long. I ordered two cases and all of the gum was mushy. When I would initially bit into the gum it would crumble apart in my mouth. After about 30 seconds of chewing it would solidify into a piece of gum. After about 30 minutes to an hour of chewing it would turn into a nasty mush in my mouth that I would have to spit out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the gum I got was not stored properly or was old. I can't recall what the expiration date was on the package, but I remember that it was not past the expiration date. I love Orbit Bubblemint Sugarfree gum. So technically I should give it 5 stars.\n",
      "However, in the 24 packs that I have received from Amazon almost half were bad. They were melted, stuck to the paper, and when we tried to chew they disintegrated. I am not sure if the warehouse that those are in, is too warm or if I just got a bad batch but I will go back and buy them at the store instead of ordering from Amazon. This is a shame since the pricing here would be awesome! I like to have gum on hand.  I especially like it as a dieting tool:  when I have the urge to eat and I'm not really hungry, I chew some gum and that usually does the trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orbit is definitely my favorite brand of gum.  I find that each piece keeps its flavor for at least an hour, and it doesn't get that dried-out, tacky feeling.  I suppose you could say that it stays moist, and doesn't really lose its texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've chewed minty flavors for years, and then last year I got into the Cinnamon flavor.  All of those are great!  I ended up buying the bubblegum flavor simply because it was much less expensive, and I figured, \"why not?!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really enjoying the flavor.  Bubblegum isn't a flavor I have very often.  It's sweet, too, which really satisfies my sugar tooth.  Plus, I like how when I have an open pack, my purse gets a sweet smell!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this was a great purchase.  You get two boxes, each of which has 14 pieces.  So, aside from just the sheer quantity of gum, I like that I have several layers of plastic wrap protecting the packs of gum.  Seriously.  I live in a climate that gets very hot and humid during the summer, and if my gum isn't protected, it gets all mushy and loses its flavor.  It gets ruined!  So, given that it will take me a while to use this whole thing, I'm very glad that each pack, and each box, is covered in cellophane and will last!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:  I definitely recommend.  Especially with the subscribe & save pricing, you can't buy good-quality gum at a better price!  And the bubble gum flavor is a sweet little treat that reminds you of when you were a kid. Bubble gum at its finest. Arrived on time, wrapped well, doesn't expire for a year, so I know it won't get tough and yucky before I go through it.  Good deal for the item, just wish it didn't have to be an add on! Great tasting gum and great deal from Amazon. I love this gum. It is so yummy and I can chew it all day long. For some reason, it is becoming more difficult to find this flavor in stores, so this big package is perfect. Plus overall, it is cheaper and more convenient to buy this way. Love this flavor. Can be hard to find in stores sometimes, so much easier to buy a big package. Well worth it. great Remix to what? Similarly to R. Kelly's jam \"Remix to Ignition\" - The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original. That being said, I like this gum. It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply. It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wrigleys-Orbit-Bubblemint-14-Count-Pack-of-12/dp/B004DIXSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wrigleys Orbit Bubblemint, 14-Count (Pack of 12)</a>. You can't win 'em all. Truth be told, that is a better gum. This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country. I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby. Review over. This is a great deal for the money. BEST. GUM. EVER!\n",

      "I LOVE LOVE LOVE the taste of this gum, especially right after my first cup of coffee at work.  I feel like it cleans my breath and I hope it cleans up some of the coffee stains (not sure it does but I HOPE).  I always have a case of this stored in my desk drawer.  One in my lunch bag, one in my purse and one in my car.  I never go ANYWHERE without it. Lots of gum for a decent price.  I won't run out of gum for a very long time.  It was fresh, not stale and old.  Would buy from again. Best. Gum. Ever! ~N Wonderful Orbit is usually my go-to gum brand, and is also usually a great product, but these pieces are hard and not at all refreshing. kids love it, last a long time This is a nice fun gum.. Seems a little hard to chew at first.. but good for the purpose of easing up on sugar... love this gum! and buying in bulk saves me $$ best gum. How could you not love Orbit Bubble Mint chewing gum? It's refreshing, and will keep your breath nice and fresh! Great gum with a flavor that lasts a long while.  I usually prefer mint gums; however, this cinnamon is a great change.  I have bought 3 cases and have not had any problems with it being hard.  Perhaps I don't chew gum for as long as others - I can say that I usually have this gum for about an hour and a half and find that the flavor is still there.  Happy chewing! Hi there, These gums are pretty nice, they release the cinnamon flavour but not for a long time. The taste is less strong compare to the classic Big Red but at least they do not contain ASPARTAME. Overall good product sugarfree Yummy! This is the best sugar free gum on the market besides the wildberry!  Small pieces, great for kids, easy to chew, and very tasty.  I recommend this to anyone who loves sugar free gum. Well...it's cinnamon gum.  It tastes good and the flavor lasts long enough.  We have bought these for years and don't look to change. I really like the cinnamon flavor of the gum, but that's about where the pros end. The gum was hard from the start, and I don't know if this is because it's too old or what. I don't mean like rock hard, but it's just too tough. The flavor lasts for maybe 10-15 minutes or so, so not great on that end either. It's just OK. It tastes good when chewing it but the flavor does not last long enough.  Other brands hold their flavor, this type after you chew it for a few minutes, the flavor vanishes away. Think big red when you order this gum.  Did you grow up chewing big red and remember people or kisses related to it?  If so you will welcome the smell and tingly of this cinnamon gum.  I will probably order this again from amazon sooner than the 6 months I set it to subscribe.  Tasty and when you open the pack the whole car smells warm and cinnamonly After the dentyne fire variety this was dull n doesn't last as long. Not bad if u can't stand the stuff that burns Fresh breath, long lasting flavor, doesn't become rubber hard after 20 minutes of chewing like so many other brands. In fact I can chew on two sticks all day and feel satisfied. I'm a bit of an compulsive gum chewer so having stashes all over the house and at work have turned into a trend.  Comes in 2 standard sizes boxes with 12 packs in each box. Always concerned with things like these when buying in bulk that they may be stale.  Everything was perfectly fresh and should keep me happily chewing for the next few months. Got this for my daughter, who lives in Istanbul.  She and  her husband love the cinnamon flavor.  Turkey has\n",
      "sugar free gum, but no cinnamon flavor.  There national brand flavor is very strange, an herb like flavor, that is\n",
      "very unappealing to the American palate. I am a recent convert to gum. My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene. I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen. It's too early to tell how effective it is in the long term, but my mouth feels cleaner. This flavor looked delicious! And it indeed is when you pop it into your mouth because it's an explosion of fruity, juicy, strawberry (tastes like watermelon thought) goodness. And while you're salivating and chomping it around in your mouth, I am NOT kidding, 20 seconds later, the flavor is sucked dry and your left with a wad of flavorless gum in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like seriously orbit, I know your other mint flavors last more than this! This is one of the gums which I have experienced that loses its flavor almost instantly! Thank god I only bought one pack, and I eat it when I'm craving something sweet and fruity and it does its job in the first 20 seconds....\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't waste your money on a whole 12-pack of this, buy one pack and test the truth! This is a good gum, but in terms of flavor it is not the best for Cinnamon flavor, that honor belongs to Big Red. That said, it is a good buy for the price. my favorite gum. very original bubble gum flavor with a hint of mint. the mint is little not over powering the bubble gum flavor. Like it better than any other gum I tried and  I've tried a lot - started chewing gum when I quit smoking - my only complaint is it seems to lose it flavor too soon and start tasting terrible guess it's made that way I love the taste of Orbit's Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor lasts, and its good for your teeth; including your dental work. My son and I love Orbit gum. It usually keeps its flavor better than other sugar-free gums. In this case, although the flavor lasts fine, the taste is not what we expected. I'm not a big fan of mint gums, but my son usually likes them. He doesn't like this flavor. The mixture of cinnamon and mint makes for a strange combination and is not one that we will buy again. AFTER CHEWING FOR SOME TIME THE GUM GETS STALE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE IT SHORTLY. OR MAYBE I JUST CHEW TOO FAST LOL NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE THOUGH. IT WAS AN ADD-ON ITEM. You are VERY lucky if you find a gum that doesn't have its flavor vanish before you've gotten in a bunch of chews.  Orbit cinnamon has a lot of flavor and you can actually sit down while chewing.  With other gums, you don't even reach your chair before you run out of flavor and have to get up to toss it away.  Best of all, it's sugar free -- that's zero calories. Can't get better than that. The picture was very clear and I liked very much the manufacture also, I received the part on time without any problem. Thanks for the job let's keep working like this satisfying correctly the customer. i was thought it might be a huge size, well, its actually normal. and we like this flavor and this brand. Orbit gum has really had some good flavors, and others that have felt more mixed than divine. When I heard they had done a strawberry gum, I wondered is it was good. Well, it could've been more with Orbit's Strawberry Remix gum. It tastes alright at first, but easily loses it flavor, faster than any gum that I have tasted in awhile. The strawberry flavor doesn't last long, only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away. I really didn't feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy. Instead, I definitely think that Wrigley's should really consider making this flavor stronger to the tee, than this would be a flavor I would recommend for anyone that needs a quick chew on the go.\n",

      "Taste: C\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: C- Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.\n",

      "Don't know why, since the fruity flavour Orbit gums were great . . . . I like orbit gum and it is vegetarian friendly. This bulk pack gives me an abundance and keeps me from having to buy a Costco membership. Even Walmart doesn't carry this quantity packaging so it's a good deal. I've ordered a lot of gum off Amazon, many different brands and flavors.  This is my favorite.  I think anywhere you buy gum, sometimes you get a stale pack or batch, but overall I've been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again. I know I chew too much gum, but I really like this gum.\n",

      "2. It has a slight mint flavor\n",
      "3. Still tastes like bubble gum. In my opinion, the Sweetmint Sugarfree Gum is the best flavor made by Orbit.  The taste is wonderfully sweet and flavorful and lasts longer than any other brand of sugar-free gum I have tried.  The fact that it is better for your teeth, being free of sugar, is only icing on the cake! I sent these to our troops in Afghanistan who wanted gum and I am sure they are very pleased. The price is great. Would rather have the whitening gum. Falls apart when chewing I do not like it at all.\n",
      "Love the Harder Pieces Yummy on those! Sugar free, great taste, pretty long lasting.  Not a lot to say about gum.  I like it a lot. Starbucks has a flavor all its own. This is a delicious Espresso blend. Although I have a Keurig and so use coffee pods I  also use my percolator at times especially when on my patio. The Starbucks dark Roast coffee is very good indeed. It is quite a strong blend which is what I enjoy and I hope to buy more when the need arises I like the deepness, though I usually mix 50:50 with something softer (like Dazbog Mocha Java). A little too bold for me to drink cup-after-cup of this straight. Not much to say other than I love Starbucks. Love their coffee and this is a good strong brew. I used it in my Keurig and it works great in the reusable KCup. All in all it is worth the price. This is just was it says it is and really good. Good stuff This espresso is great but I must have read the size wrong because you can get this same size at the grocery store for half of the price. It was my mistake though. have been a user for several years.  starbucks is the best and really not that expensive as I only have a couple cups of joe in the morning.  never thought about the descriptive \"espresso\" as I don't use it for that though some could find it misleading. as for me who likes  it bold and like mud its perfect. YUM!! I bought this coffee when I ran out of my favorite espresso coffee, Goya. It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes, so I figured it might be worth it. First, it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine. Second, it seems to be among the more bitter of any grocery store espresso coffees that I have ever bought. Even with milk and sugar, I could not mask the bitterness. I won't be buying it again. I was looking for a decaf the was a full rich medium roast with a wonderful satisfying flavor. Starbucks failed to deliver. Dunkin Donuts House Decaf is for me the gold standard in this category. This coffee is soooooooo good! I bought it after I started experiencing heartburn from my over consumption of regular coffee. So in the AM, I have a 20 oz. regular, then the 16 oz decaf. If you get heartburn, this is a good choice.....I would defy anyone to tell it's decaf. I bought mine @ TJ Maxx @ a steal! Don't know why it was so low priced.....possibly due to the May best buy date.....I bought in March, or that it was in the old blue print bag? Don't know, but I got one 12oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it. After trying it, went back and bought 3 more bags.....wish now, that I would have bought a case. The price was phenominal - ending up being .50/oz, compared to Starbuck's price of .81/oz and Amazon's price of .74/oz. I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ, but alas, that story's over. Amazon's price is good and this is where I'll order going forward, now that I'm hooked! We live in NYC and this stuff goes for $14-15 per bag in most stores. Amazon's price (3 for $23) is an amazing discount. Plus, this coffee is excellent. Five stars. There's nothing like Starbucks for a morning pick me up. The very best. An excellent value. Highly recommend the product. Robust full flavor, for the discriminating coffee drinker. Real coffee flavor for a decaf. I highly recommend it, as I do with all Starbucks products. Excellent Great coffee What can you say, it's Starbucks!  I French Press this and the taste is amazing. Love Starbucks, best tasting coffee! good coffee, timely delivery Tastes like an old ashtray. Scorched and garbage-y. Even half and half couldn't mellow it. I actually threw the rest of the brand new bag in the garbage after making just one small pot. This coffee is strong and slightly bitter. It would probably taste much better if I added milk or sugar to cut down on the bitterness, but I prefer to drink black coffee. With a choice between this or other weak flavored or watery coffees, I'd choose this one every time, but there are other brands that have the same strength without the bitterness. great Thanks Great coffee, but high price. Local stores no longer carry the decafe. Very nice indeed. Love this product! Has a very good flavor and aroma.  Makes for a good cup of coffee with or without cream or sugar. Great robust flavor for those who like their coffee strong.  I am hooked on the taste and look forward to it every day.  Even though it is medium blend and decaf it still has the zing to it that makes it popular with many.\n",
      "I plan to buy more when this is gone. This is exactly what I was looking for but couldln't find at more local store. I wouldln't have ordered it if I didn't have PRIME, way over-priced. These are nice, they add a little shimmer. works well Did not like this at all. I purchased two bottles of these to use for wedding cupcakes and I'm glad I taste tested them before decorating my desserts because it would of turned into one of my worst nightmares. I sprinkled some on a dollop of whipped frosting I made and ate it and it was just terrible. The texture of this is exactly like thin plastic flakes and they do not dissolve easily when eaten. I had to use my front teeth to smash these down while they stuck to my teeth and it just wasn't an enjoyable experience since it felt like I was eating plastic. I'm very disappointed in this product and wouldn't recommend it. Very small jar.  My fault for not realizing it. Clearly this is not for everyone. In my opinion, the sparkles are flavorless once added to frosting, icing and the like. I think it's the texture that's odd. I mean it's odd in the best sense of the word. There is something to be said about the unique texture it gives to your finished goodies. It's snow-like; I'd even say glass-like. It especially looks cool when you match the color of sparkles to the color of icing (e.g. pink icing with pink sparkles). I can't think of anything else on the market comparable to this. I've tried it on flooded icing when making sugar cookies and frosted cupcakes. I think it's worth trying. I like it! Nice I use at least a jar of these every year for the snow on a winter cake, and it's great stuff. Very sparkly, but subtle, and doesn't add a lot of crunch the was sparkling sugar does. Very pricey online but just as expected These flakes of shimmering sugar candy are fantastic!!!! They give elegance to any cake!  I though them on after cake is finished and looks fantastic!!!!! I always keep them on hand! A little disappointed in this product. This is more clear then sparkle. I wanted to put them on top of pink cupcakes for a wedding shower, but this was barely noticeable. love! Add a little class to the top of cakes!  Recommend using by all means. Must have for adding sparkle to cakes!  The only thing I like better is airbrushing shimmer onto cakes!  But, these sparkles can be sprinkled on cakes, cupcakes, etc. thank you great Love them. Very light and feathery. Beautiful color. Very nice. There is nothing glittery or sparkly about these sprinkles. I ordered the purple and expected the product to look like glitter, not tiny cut up pieces of plastic. It's not what I wanted at all, these should not be advertised as sparkles. Confetti would be better suited. Will never purchase these again. Great for finishing touch! Not too big but enough to give a nice shine like crystals didnt use it yet but they're oretty They do shimmer. They are a little expensive for a tiny jar of sprinkles. Okay sprinkles, great seller. Easy to use and lovely to look at on my cake. great product, excellent shipping. have used this product for years and I was very satisfied. I like being able to get what I need. I've never seen edible glitter on a confection before, and the guests at our 5 year old's party were impressed.  Several asked if they could really eat it.  It doesn't taste like anything, so it's just for looks, but very shiny and cute.  I found them easy to apply, just tap the container lightly, but I don't mind a random effect...they're sprinkles after all, and a little clumping doesn't look bad at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tried the hearts and stars, which I preferred a bit.  These melted into the frosting a bit after storing in the fridge, but the stars and hearts kept their shape.  This product might best be used as a \"fill\" for stencils. Came quickly and was the deep purple I anticipated. And the best part is was about 1/2 the cost of what was offered in the store. Cake sparkles are intended to give just that; a bit of twinkling color.  If used alone, the impact is subtle.  If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath.  I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies.  After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top.  The icing will hold them in place.  The two layers create a beautiful, richer look.  Think of a precious stone.  Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle.  But, with facets and light, it comes to life.  That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing.  I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.\n",

      "Wilton consistently provides excellent quality supplies and I've been using their products for about 34 years. sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and don't show up as nicely as they should, container was 1/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself. Great combo.  Works well together.  Tastes great. Love the Zone bars but can only find them on Amazon.com.  Lucky for me. My daughter gave me one of the peanut butter bars, and I loved it. It also filled me up for the next few hours. I ordered them soon after, and both my husband and I think t hey are great! Delicious. My favorite energy bar. Super delicious, and the price was better than the regular grocery store. No complaints.  Good taste, good price, fast delivery. Love these, but I didn't realize that there were two different flavors in the box. These are pretty good, but, I am doing Weight Watchers and wanted a marginally nutritious meal replacement bar for when I don't have time. These little boogers are 8 SmartPoints each! They're loaded with sugar and fat! And, they're not that big. No sir. So, I'm going to carefully finish these and never buy this again. NEVER! These bars are awesome as a meal replacement (or a snack depending on your hunger!).  These are my two favorite flavors.  Unlike many other protein bars, these do not taste chalky at all.  The flavors are delicious!  I highly recommend trying them.  You will not be disappointed! good Delicious and nutritious Delicious, but way too much sugar. Tasty and filling. yummy Delicious! Great product! One of my favorite flavors! Not my favorite protein bars but not horrible either Great product...just as seller described Taste great I love Zone bars but this box of bars had seen better days.  They are edible but the chocolate coating is splotchy and the bars are on the tough and dry side.  Not a Zone bar issue...the brand is fantastic and I have enjoyed them for years...hoping this was just an isolated box. Good value and good flavors. I love Zone bars! Never want to be without these! Good to have around all the time! Love these!!!!! will order more tomorrow. I already reviewed the item and felt negatively about it. First the bar has 15gr. of sugar and 200 calories and relative a low protein content.  I don't consider it a health bar.  It is of course my fault for assuming that the Zone contains low amount of sugar.  The sugar makes me hungry after an hour. They're great to have in my purse while doing errands. It is what we like! We were introduced to these at Costco and love them.  Great product. Tastes great, filling and lasts with you a long time. My daughter keeps one in her car when she doesn't have enough time between clients to eat a sit down lunch. I eat them to keep from eating a pint of ice cream as the bars are healthy and very satisfying. So glad we tried these. These were shipped fast! I love the graham taste. Very good bars! Very filling. great for poaching eggs in the micro=wave Not great for baking, you still need to flour the pan afterwards. I currently use it the same way you'd use original Pam. Great stuff, better than Pam Great price. We make a lot of cakes in this house. We do not have time to add a cake that breaks to our day. We used to flour and oil our cake pans. But they would break or the side would stick. When I discovered this spray I hoped it would work. It does!!! It is the only spray I will use for my cakes. I just spray the pan and add the cake batter! It makes life so much easier. Don't spray the pan and then let it sit. Spray the pan and then add the batter as soon as possible.  I always keep this spray around. It is a must for perfect cakes. This spray is a time saver. I am so glad I have it on my shelf now! excellent product, wonderful transaction. thanks! works beautifully - especially for bundt cakes & a lot easier than butter & flour I often bake cakes and after struggling with them sticking to the pan I got this. It was perfect. Now, my cakes and other treats never stick. This is a must buy for anyone who has ever baked in their life! I have never used a non stick spray in a cake pan before.. but recently i purchased two very elaborate bundt cake pans that had lots of tips and points..they are more like a mold than a cake pan.  I decided to try Wiltons spray and see it if worked.  Its certainly easy enough to use.. spray the pan and add your batter and bake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did follow someones suggestion on releasing the cake which was to take the cake out of the oven and let it sit untouched for ten full minutes... then I used a soft spatula to run along the sides between the cake and the pan.. and inverted the cake onto a plate. I tapped the bottom of the pan several times then gently lifted the pan.. and the cake came out perfect.  I made three cakes with three different pans using the same method.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be noted that I sprayed the pans quite liberally with the spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can only base my review on what I experienced.. but it worked well for me both times... so I am giving it a thumbs up as it is working well with my bundt cake pans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this review was helpful for you.  I have enclosed a few photos to show the detail on the cake and how it released well from the pan. Its fine. Still have some when we like it. I don't bake without it thanks great I love this product! I use it for all of my baking, frying, whatever needs! I've been using this for years and have yet to have a cake stick. It is flavorless as well. Works great for ALL baked goods. My cakes, bars, brownies, muffins, etc. never ever stick when I use this. I think it works better than flour/butter in the pan. I do love this product.  I don't bake a cake without it. i never use any other spray. leaves no taste that would take away from my food and my cakes come off the pan with ease I could not find this in the stores I love using this cause it does not change the taste of the food You can buy it for less in stores such as Joann's and Michael's but it is great for baking and I always make sure I have it in my pantry. These sugar crystals are shiny black  I use them against a white royal icing for terrific contrast.  When used on black royal icing, they make your finished product shimmer with depth.  They really make my cookies pop with a colorful sparkle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip:  If you are decorating cookies, place waxed paper or a paper towel beneath the cookie you are decorating.  When you're done, it makes it much easier to put back into the jar the crystals that never made it onto your cookies.  That saves you money and time. Beautiful color. Perfect on our pumpkin cookies I actually purchased these to make desserts for a high school graduation party since these are the school colors. Came out nice and I didn't have to buy 2 different shakers of sprinkles! Just what I needed for my patriotic cupcakes! around Christmas they always run out.  so now I won't run out.  great sugar sprinkles. k Just like the ones in the store. Bright colored sprinkles great for King Cakes! LOVE Wilton sorinkles are the standard in our kitchen. Horrible product. Absolutely NO shimmer. I used these black sugar sprinkles in a dessert and was embarrassed to see that it dyed everyone's mouth greenish black after eating it. I'm not talking just a little bit....it was hard to get off and pretty gross. It was also hard to get out of the counter top after cooking with them. The remaining bit of this stuff went in the trash. used them for my chocolate covered pretzel sticks MORE WHITE SPRINKLES THAN SHAMROCK ONES. BUT OK PRODUCT. Needed these I refer these over the grocery brand I used to buy. Much finer and more vibrant. Recommended. Also, arrived in ample time for Xmas baking despite my ordering them at the last minute. I'm a fan of Wilton products.  Rarely do I ever get something that is lacking in quality.  I picked up the \"Cinnamon Drops\" to use as noses for my reindeer cake pops.  They worked great, looked great and taste great!  Definitely would purchase these again. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wilton-Black-Cake-Sparkles/dp/B0000VMA52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wilton Black Cake Sparkles</a>&nbsp;were quite a disappointment because they were more green than black.  Black can appear in many hues and this one isn't the best.  I ended up finding Black Sanding Sugar at Williams Sonoma that I used for my purpose instead of this and found that the flavor of that product also was better than these sparkles.  If you're not particular about your black color, these may be satisfactory, so I've given these two stars instead of the one I really wanted to select.  I'm curious to know what's the difference between this product and the product that comes up at a lower price when a search is done for \"Wilton Black Sugar Sparkles\" on this website.  Image and description are exactly the same, and both are available now via the Amazon Prime Add On Program. Just like the icing used on expensive bought cakes!  Perfect to have on hand for \"emergency\" baking sessions.  Buy it you will like it! I used cream, and put it on a white cake and my husband just loved it. Note one box does one layer of a two layer cake. Using powdered sugar with butter and vanilla and milk tastes better and would be cheaper.  Would not buy this again. My friends and I all agree that this is the best tasting frosting! Mine comes out beautiful white, frosted the cake with smooth perfection and set up perfectly for decoration. This will be a staple for my future in cake decoration! As expected Delicious Icing - Great Flavor.  Mix up icing quickly to frost or decorate a cake or cupcakes. I am CONSTANTLY baking and this icing always gets awesome remarks. Most people are convinced it is homemade! It is light, fluffy and hard not to eat before you get it onto the cake!! The taste was fine, but it certainly did NOT make enough to frost even just the top of a 9x13 cake.  You would need maybe three of these. Growing up in a typical Puerto Rican family, all we knew was Pilon coffee. Now as an adult with my own family, nothing wakes me up like the aroma of freshly brewed Pilon. Hispanics are all about their coffee and Pilon is definitely one of the best. Try it, you won't be disappointed. unlike other islander coffee, Bold & Strong Cuban Coffee as expected. will purchase again. This coffee has a bitter taste but i enjoyed it i would buy it again  This is a nice roast and authentic Cuban bean. It's a good change from my normal coffee - has a nice taste and I use it with a super automatic machine with ease. Not an oily bean. First off, my usual espresso is the Starbucks brand.  I just like a strong flavor.  I want to HAVE to put some cream and suger in my coffee for it to be tolerable.  The first thing I noticed upon tasting PILON is that it's VERY strong yet VERY smooth.  I can't say that for the Starbucks brand espresso...actually at all.  I still put cream and suger in my americano's but I use less water, more espresso, and less sugar and cream.  That's because the flavor of this coffee is SO perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living in Chicago it's easy to find good espresso's, as intelligentsia and metropolis make excellent coffee for the larger brands here, but nothing really compares to the smooth cuban like flavoring of PILON.  Seriously try some if you're an espresso lover like me and would rather drink any kind of espresso drink than BLAH coffee.\n",

      "This stuff is for REAL. I'm an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, plus I've been a fan of Chef Prudhomme's delicious recipes for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.  And you won't go wrong with the remainder of the items, which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MSG. These are the BEST blended seasonings I've ever used. The added flavor is wonderful and provides and additional kick to meats and veggies. Item as described I love these spice combos and they save lots of individual measuring. They are as helpful in the kitchen as Minors Chicken Base. I'm all for convenience as long as they help me produce delicious nutritious meals. These arrived quickly and well packed. Meh Love these.  Low carb, great taste.\n",

      "I used the magic meat to make a friend dinner and she spent a good part of the evening trying to figure out what combo of spices I'd used...it's now my secret ingredient =) Great flavoring Gifted to sister. She loved the variety. When it's too cold or rainy to grill, use this on the range or in the broiler.  But turn on the fan first. Not worth the money. Good great taste one of the best spices on the planet and if do not have then you need to get this nice selection of spices Haven't quite tried them all yet but these are great spices, yummy. A great vareity of Magic Blends. Each one brings a nice flavor to the meat that is recommended. The vegetable blend is used daily on just about every vegetable I eat. Very flavorful and tasty. Does not overpower the meat or vegetables. Add a lot of flavor. Worth it Great seasonings Coworker informed me to try Magic seasoning! I thank him after every meal prepared with this seasoning! Thanks Excellent selection Found it cheaper here than local glocery store. Great Buy. They really do all seem really close in flavor... Not good at all...all taste the same\n",
      "And meat seasoning taste like taco seasoning.\n",
      "Vegetable seasoning taste like something fake.\n",
      "I have not tried the chicken and seafood...doesnt even want to. Iwill return it great purchase.  Spices mixed real nice and ads great flavor to my cooking\n",
      "Would buy again I love these seasonings, and the variety is really convenient. I often mix my own seasonings, but when I don't have time, I use the Chef Paul seasonings. I have used all of these, and they go a long way. I keep these and other Chef Paul seasonings on hand at all times. I doubt Chef Paul had anything at all to do with these spices. They are surprisingly bland and all taste the same. You will literally get a much better result merely using sea salt and fresh ground pepper. The Magic Seasoning Blends are a staple in our house!  I keep them stocked in our pantry.  The blends are great, flavorful, and compliment a wide range of foods.  My favorites are the Barbeque and Salt Free Seasoning.  Alone or combined to create your own mix, these blends are awesome.  We love to use the Barbeque on steaks and ribs or mixed into baked beans.  The Fajita blend is great for making marinades or adding to ground beef for tacos.  The Salt Free and original Seasoning are great for anything and everything.  I will admit that I have yet to try the Salmon seasoning.  The others I have purchased previous and jumped at the chance to try this 5 pack.  You just can't beat the price.  Most of these, if and when I can find them locally, are $5.50 and above.  I definitely will be purchasing these again.  Planning on gifting a set to my dad who LOVES to cook! I use one of these everytime I cook and I love these seasonings. After having used the seasoning salt for years, and running out of my current can, I decided to try the set.  I'm glad I did.  I still use the seasoning salt the most, then the salmon seasoning next, and the others rarely.  Still, they're all good. UPDATE:-\n",

      "Oh boy was I so pleased!\n",

      "Chef Paul really got it spot on when he made one seasoning blend for vegetables, meat, poultry and seafood. They pretty much have the same main ingredients but each one has that extra couple of ingredients that makes what ever your having taste amazing! Today I thought I would try the Vegatable blend with my pasta w/pesto and OMG, did it taste so so good! I am so happy with the blends I got.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get all my lunches at work from a diet centre so sometimes I am stuck with very boring choices. I decided to keep Poultry, Seafood and Vegetables in the office with me at all times and and will keep the Meat Magic at home for my steaks :)\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:- I just used the Meat Magic over the weekend and WOW! I put a generous amount on every new york strip before grilling along with coconut oil and clarified butter (ghee) and oh man it tasted amazing! I have done close to a hundred steaks with different seasoning and marinade and this has got to be the best so far!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am considering buying another set for the house as I would like to always have all flavors on hand wherever I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the great product! Spices are great Excellent package deal.  This should last us for awhile.  Some of the best seasonings out there. I especially love the seafood, chicken and pork and veal seasonings. My only wish is that we could build our own sets or buy two or three of the flavors we want. I had to buy the 24 oz of  the veal and pork seasoning - which is not replaceable - in my mind - to have it at all.  It lives in my freezer and I fill an old bottle as needed. these are only 2 ounce bottles.  I thought this was a 7 pack of 7.2 ounce bottles.  Read carefully!  NOT WORTH THE PRICE. As expected. Given as a gift to someone who loves cooking. I love Chef Paul seasoning. Taste is amazing. I was first introduced at santa monica seafood. they recommend I try the Fish seasoning on my grilled salmon. Wow! Taste blew my taste buds. It really adds flavor. The really cool thing is this set of four different seasonings has l;asted much longer than expected. there is allot of seasoning in each bottle. Whether I use this on ribs or pork shoulder, my barbecue turns out professional quality -- or better. Recently, I served St. Louis-cut ribs seasoned 24 hours ahead with Barbecue Magic. Not only were they a hit, several guests said they were better than the ribs at a famous upscale casual barbecue chain (and I agree). Chef Paul is the guru of herbs & spices, and like all his seasonings, this product is world class. The flavor is perfectly balanced with a light, natural smokiness, and is absolutely NOT hot. Perfect for beef, poultry, pork, as well as other meats and countless dishes. I have used all of Paul Prudhomme's seasonings and I love them all. They are spicy but not hot and very flavorful. If you are trying to use less salt this is the answer. I have been buying Chef Prudhomme's spices for well over a year.  I am never disappointed with them.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic, Meat Magic and even though it's not part of this pack I buy the toasted onion and garlic.  It's great when I bake fresh vegetables.  Before purchasing from Amazon compare the prices with his website because sometimes they are cheaper. This is a great and easy way to create genuine barbecue flavoring for your chicken, beef, or pork. You can use it either as part of a marinade or a rub. And you can use it when cooking on the grill, in the oven, on the stovetop, or in the barbecue pit. In a word, it's versatile. But not just that. The taste is great and provides a natural smoky flavor to whatever you're cooking. We've tried it on a number of occasions, and we've never been disappointed. The recommended serving size is 1/4 tsp., which means that a little goes a long way. Very good Wonderful assortment. Taste fantastic. Watch holes in top of shakers as they are large and the volume you expect is way higher when using them. I would recommend. My husband and I cannot eat much salt and this suites us fine.  It tastes so good.  You would not know how low the salt is so you can use it for flavoring.  I like that you have it for beef, pork,,poultry, etc.  Very good. We absolutely love these spices! They are our go to spices for any dish. The one for poultry is so good we needed to buy a large container of the Poultry one as it is used so much (found it in the supermarket). Also makes a great gift! Love this unique combo of spices! There is a wonderful undertone of anise. I can't eat steak without it now My friends and family think I am a cooking genious....until I explain that I used Chef Paul's Magic Seasoning Blends. We were introduced to these blends at a dinner party, and our pantry could not be complete without keeping this product well stocked. From fish to beef, this product would be difficult to beat. This stuff has a bite to it, so start with a little and adjust from there.\n",
      "We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it, and WOW!!!!! burn your lips off hot..\n",
      "We have since learned to cut the rub with a bit of brown sugar and comes out perfect.. Usually a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products, this one does not blow my mind. The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.\n",

      "The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer Bob's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this. I mix this with regular rolled oats to give it some better texture. Not sure if I would like the 6 grain but my hesitation was for naught.  Love this cereal but the amounts had to be halved (directions) or we would be feeding four instead of two!  Tastes great and especially good on those cold mornings when oatmeal just seems bland.  Would buy again. Excellent value.  I store these in the freezer and make pancakes out of them after mixing with equal parts yogurt and letting it sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours as explained in \"Nourishing Traditions\" by Sally Fallon. It's healthy, great when topped with sliced banana. Wholesome food with a glass of milk. Ordered this thinking it was 6 grain hot cereal more like the oatmeal style as with other brands, but its cream of wheat essentially, which is sooo gross to me.  If you like cream of wheat, you will like this, but it is NOT the oatmeal style. I like this product. I was not compensated or given item at a discount in exchange for this review. This is something I purchased because I either wanted or needed the item.\n",
      "This was an opps order as I meant to order steel cut oatmeal and got this instead. Happy it worked out this way cause would have never tried otherwise. This stuff is great! It really volumes up after preparing as well. Less of an oatmeal type and more porridge. Easy peasy to prepare, I make a weeks worth in Tupperware and heat up what I need in morning with 1/2 cup milk with raisins dash of cinnamon or fresh fruit if I have. Fills the tummy nicely for several hours and reading the label can't believe something so yummy us soo good for you. I whole heartily recommend this product. Great cereal, easy to make, great texture, baby loves it Good stuff.  Healthy, tasty, and best of all...organic, which is the reason I bought it.  I can get multi grain cereal at my local health food store but many times not organic.  Easy to order on line and probably a little less expensive for the larger quantities.  Lately I have been mixing it with a little Kaniwa, which my local Sprouts had on sale, and the combo is also good, and makes it 7 grain instead of 6. This is wonderful, filling cereal.  As part of a plan to improve my diet I began eating cooked cereal for breakfast every morning. This is a big part of that. It is very tasty, and filling. like this cereal Almost tasteless, not much bulk to it. This is as easy to make as instant oatmeal, but much more nutritious and cost effective. It has a wholesome, nutty taste. I eat it almost every day for breakfast, since I can make it quickly and easily at work. I just pour some of this hot cereal and water in my bowl without actually measuring but still trying to following the proportions in the label (1:3), and then I microwave it for 3 minutes. I usually add a little milk and top it with some fruit, like banana or raspberries. Sometimes right after cooking I stir in a little natural almond butter or peanut butter, which goes great with banana.\n",

      "Like all Bob's Red Mill products I've tried so far, I highly recommend this hot cereal! I love Bob's Red Mill, and their hot cereal is always delicious. I love this blend as it provides wonderful nutrients and acts as a great base for so many oatmeal combinations. I am very fond of this particular hot cereal (porridge). I usually cook in vanilla almond or soy milk for extra nutrition. Cooked in a double boiler, I can start it and do other things for 20-30 minutes before dishing up a satisfying breakfast for my family. If there is a bit left over, I add it to my pancake or waffle batter the next day. Yum! Overall a nice different hot cereal great if you make it with unsweetened cocoa powder and add your preferred sweetener Very good vanilla extract and organic too! This comes in a close second to my homemade organic vanilla extract. Will keep a bottle in my cabinet, while waiting for mine to \"develop\". Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk. Wow! Simply the best tasting vanilla extract I have ever used! I hope it continues to be marketed with this kind of quality. As long as it is, it will be the only liquid vanilla flavor I use. We always use this vanilla.  It is wonderful for homemade ice cream, cookies, and cakes! Great flavor and quality product 1. Good quality vanilla extract\n",
      "2. You don't need a lot to feel it Very good vanilla extract, yes there is a difference in regular McCormick artificially flavored vanilla. This is actually an extract of real vanilla beans plus its organic to boot. Definately get this one if you want true vanilla flavor. Really like this!!! Has a great flavor.  Have used it in several recipes and it works well. Good quality however, just about every organic vanilla extract on the market has alcohol in it and a lot of alcohol because of an FDA regulation requiring 35% alcohol in vanilla extract (IMHO a useless stupid rule). I don't like alcohol. I find that buying the Grade A vanilla pods (which might take awhile if they come from Asia) allows me to make about five times the amount of extract for the same amount of money. My home-made extract is far stronger than even the best and without alcohol. I use a lot of vanilla. This bottle is small, and overpriced but it is better quality than the others in the same category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla is anti-carcinogenic. Alcohol causes disease. Do you think the FDA has your best interests in mind? Abby's advice: get pods and make a glycerin or oil extract yourself. Smells really good. I like the flavor.\n",

      "sweetner of choice If only this came in a large size. Love Organic products! I am slowly switching all our kitchen purchases to organic and this has been a great vanilla at a reasonable price. The bottle is plastic and small but the product has been a winner. I could never go back to the early days of using imitation vanilla! This is the best vanilla I have ever used. Excellent quality vanilla, My family is enjoying it very much.  Got here fast and perfect condition. Very good and even better knowing it is organic. Like I said I will continue buying this product.i do a lot of  cooking. This bottle is a steal, at Whole Foods (at least where I live) a bottle half this size costs twice as much. Before I was also using imitation vanilla, it smells okay but you can smell the fillers. This bottle smells like fresh, pure vanilla. I used it in a lemon poppy seed cake and it was delicious, mild and aromatic! My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL! This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast. So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job. Great flavor! Yummy bars Last night I  bought a Luna Chocolate Peppermint Stick for dessert with my evening meal. The texture was somewhat like saw-cutting grains stuck together but the flavor was quite good, one of the better-tasting nutrition bars. Not bad at all. I guess the granular thingy indicates a lot of fiber, and I can stand that. My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market had them on sale for a buck each. Good deal.\n",

      "Gary Peterson They are my absolute favorites. I get them on auto delivery so I never run out. My 15 year old granddaughter loves them too. The best Luna bar so far. They come as close to the girl scout cookies, Samoas. This bar is healthy and DELICIOUS! These two adjectives aren't usually used together when describing a health bar. I slightly heat this bar up in the microwave (at 10 seconds) and drink a glass of milk with this bar. Pretty standard fare for a Luna Bar, which is pretty much a good thing.  Soy crisps laden with pretzel pieces, peanuts, peanut butter smears and peanut butter chips; there is a peanut butter-y sort of candy coating on the bottom portion.  If only there were dark chocolate chips or pieces tossed in the mix...  I guess I'm just a chocoholic, but the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Luna-Bar-Chocolate-Dipped-Coconut-25-4-Ounce-15-Bars/dp/B00498HGG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Luna Bar Chocolate Dipped Coconut, 25.4-Ounce, 15-Bars</a>&nbsp;really raised the bar on Luna products for me.  All in all, a pretty tasty treat! I'm an almond joy freak, so I was hoping this would be like those candy bars.  It's not- but it's really good anyway.  The chocolate is rich and delicious.  The coconut flavor is much more subdued than in an almond joy (or even in the coconut cookies I am familiar with)- but though it's subdued, you CAN tast it.  It's just not like a macaroon- but there is coconut flavor.  The bar has a nice texture- and I certainly love the way no one flavor overpowers the bar.  This is one excellent snack bar if you can handle the calories 190, and if you don't have a problem with 11 g of sugar. I do the order for a small grocery store.  When I saw this flavor in the order guide, I ordered it without hesitation.  Luna Bars always sell well, even though I personally am weary of Luna Bars with chocolate in them; the chocolate usually tastes funky, waxy.  Once it arrived, I tried one.  Soooo good!  It's hard to believe that this treat offers health benefits, it's THAT good.  It tastes like a macaroon.  Heaven.  It is now the top selling flavor at the store. Of all of the Luna Bar flavors, the Chocolate Peppermint Stick is my favorite.  It is very minty and easily chewable.  You don't have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it.  The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty.  If I had not looked at the wrapper, I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar (try doing that with other protein/meal replacement/nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration.)  There is also no vitamin taste.\n",

      "Overall, the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals.  As it has less than 200 calories, it can be classified as a snack.  I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I can't leave for lunch.\n",

In addition, I tend to avoid protein bars covered in chocolate, as I have found that the chocolate often tastes quite artificial.

      "I am pleased to report that this bar was delicious!  The chocolate/coconut blend is quite reminiscent of the flavor of a Mounds chocolate bar and not artificial tasting at all--rather, it was rich and chewy, with no unpleasant aftertaste.  In addition, the nutrition profile of this bar is comparable to other Luna bars:  190 calories, 7 grams fat (a bit high, but only 3.5 grams saturated, and no trans fats), 25 grams total carbs, including 3 grams fiber and only 11 grams of sugar, and 9 grams of protein.

      "First time I read about this online I decided to try it out. I stopped by my local Publix and checked to see if they have any in stock. They have most of the flavours here except for a few and some (6?) pack boxes of certain flavours. They're $.79 each, not including tax of course. I bought quite a couple, I think 6. I'll try to dig up the wrappers and see which flavour, but the chocolate peppermint blew me away!\n",

I could gobble mine down in a few seconds and it's easy to chew which helps my teeth. Probably one of the best tasting out of the Luna and Cliff bars. I even like this peppermint better than the GeniSoy one. It didn't melt in my messenger bag which is a benefit, but I'm thinking about keeping an ice pack just in case, but it's nearing winter.

      "are a good deal I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging \"palm kernel oil\" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many \"organic\" things are added to it.\n",

      "For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. Excellent Organic Peanut Butter! I agree with other reviewers, you should when FIRST OPEN JAR STIR IN CENTER SLOWLY, to let the oil on top seep down and mix properly.  Then you're good to go and enjoy Peanut butter & Jelly soft bread sandwiches. I'm getting the non salt version, though only 80 mg of sodium in this type, unlike alot of commercial brands that have 100 mg or more. The title of this review says it all. There is something seriously amiss with the thinking apparatus of anyone who will spend 23$ for one jar of peanut butter. No? This product has a good taste, it is also fortunate that unlike other brands this seems to be the easiest to spread on toast after taking out of the fridge (though it still is not as easy as it should be and does require patience) I first tried this about 15 years ago, and I've stocked it in my spice cabinet ever since! I use this on everything from Eggs to Pasta to Pizza. There's no salt in this stuff, just lots of Herbs, Spices, and Parmesan!\n",
      "Great Stuff! Be Careful though, it can be addictive! I randomly bought this at a grocery store one day and absolutely LOVED it. I put this in all kinds of recipes (even mac & cheese) and it works miracles. It's THE BEST! I always use a lot of spices in my food, but this is the only one that I actually find myself craving at times. When I only had a couple teaspoons left I added it to my Parmesan shaker and it is heavenly that way as well. It is not salty, like most seasoning blends.  It adds just enough pizazz to anything.  It works on pizza, pasta, toast, rice, salad, just about anything that you can think of.  Let your imagination go wild!  This is a great product. :) This makes a lot of food taste great - subs, deep fried mushrooms, pizza. Adds great flavor to pizzas and pasta.  Just shake it on.  I have used this for years but now I can't find it local where I live.  Glad I found it on Amazon. We've been using this for years! The blend is unique and full of flavor. Most pizza seasonings we have bought tasted predominantly of oregano, but this one brings in layers of red pepper and Parmesan cheese without being too herbal.  We use it on pizza, but we also use it on spaghetti squash, grilled veggies, etc. We don't go crazy with it, a bottle lasts a long time. It's almost impossible to find locally now, so it's good to know that it's available here. I've been looking for a pizza seasoning and read the reviews and decided to try it. I really is an added taste to any slice of pizza. Not sure what all it has in it but it is really good!! Next stop is adding it to pasta. I have been using this for years! Great on tortellini with just some olive oil. Adds great flavor to any pasta or garlic bread. A staple in my kitchen. Always the best This is a must for anyone's spice cabinet, but cannot find it in my area.  This is a very great product. One of my favorite seasonings since it's so versatile. Goes great with pizza and pasta, but it's basically my default Italian seasoning. I found this too hot.  Too many hot pepper flakes. Been using this one for over 8 years. Never lets your pizza flavor become dull! Very good seasoning..among the top ones in my opinion. Give it a try...you won't be sorry!\n",
      "UPDATE; Don't know what happened here, but this bottle was really bad...I mean throw away your food bad. Maybe a fluke.....or is this another great product gone by by? Date was good on bottle. I love this product.  I use it with pasta and even eggs and pizza of course.  Oh, yes, sometimes I sprinkle it over popcorn.  It came quickly and in good shape.  KayM ... 4.23.16 Absolutely delicious. I use it on pizza all the time. I haven't tried it on pasta but I'm sure it's delicious on that too. Love this for use on our pizza crust.  Everytime we make pizza, we sprinkle this on our pizza crust.  It tastes amazing and adds that \"special something\" to our meals.  Also throw it in pasta sauce! We love this seasoning so much I use it on frozen pizza too not just homemade. great product and vendor best out there,,,delicious Good stuff. Essentially, it is just parmesan cheese with some spices, so you are really paying alot for the brand name. I would not repurchase. Great Product really good spice like it adds flavor to pizza and pasta My husband loves pizza and loves this stuff too. So glad we found it and that amazon carries it I was really looking for something with more punch to it. Even though I have used it several times on pizza, I can only barely paste the spice. It seems to work better when used after your food is cooked. i use the red version(sweet and spicy) for regular pizza's.\n",
      "but this one i use on white sauce pizza's and also i use it in butter\\olive oil garlic sauces for pasta.\n",
      "it gives a nice zing to the oil and it tastes very good :-)\n",
      "its mostly garlic,herbs and parmasean cheese :-) I've used this for years but my local grocery stores don't carry it anymore. It's great with any pasta dish & I put it on all pizzas! I use this for all dishes that call for Italian seasoning. It works great for a variety of casseroles too. As always the \"Chef\" doesn't disappoint, this is SO good ! very flavorful.  Would recommend to anyone who would like to try and alternative seasoning that doesn't have all that sodium. This pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is, MAGIC!  It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce, meatballs, or any dish.  The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories, no fat, no salt, no carbohydrates and no MSG to your food.  It also contains no preservatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good.  We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more!  I recommend it to you. If you want a full flavor, real-deal Olive Oil, this is it. I stir it in practically everything. It adds an entirely new and wonderful flavor to spaghetti sauce. I brush it on garlic bread. Uses are endless. Great stuff. I love this oil!  I love garlic and adding this oil with infused flavor to most dishes really adds to the taste.  For example, I make crostinis and instead of regular olive oil, I use Annie's and it makes them sing with flavor.  I even use it for the oil when I'm roasting garlic. I am always trying to increase the flavor of food without the taste of spices being overpowering.  This oil is a good option for cooking foods, especially when stir frying meat and veggies.  The taste is strong enough without being STRONG. I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.\n",

      "I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys! I like this WHEN it works. Theres inconsistency with the spray which is a major pain when working on a cake or wanting uniformity. Sometimes there is no color, sometimes speckles, sometimes its perfect. Just a light spray will do, it's pretty works great! I am writing this based on my use with FROSTING a cakesprayed this on a red velvet cake since cream cheese frosting has a bit of a yellow cast on it and this worked great and gave my cake a nice pearly look to it without compromising taste. I sprayed about 8 inches away from the cake and sprayed evenly on the topreally changed the top coat color nicely and evenly. Cake tasted fine. I love that this product doesn't taint the entire frosting as regular gel or food coloring would do. It is messy so be prepared to cover surface underlying baked good to be sprayed. No need to over spraygave one quick even coat and a few minutes later another one and it gave me the results I wanted.\n",
      "Would purchase again without a question! I purchased the Pearl Color mist here on Amazon and personally picked up the Black and Pink color mist at a local craft store and they all gave me great results and the attached pictures show all 3 colors on my cakes. Excellent way of capturing an ombr&eacute;/gradient look. The black mist was used on top of chocolate cake and hard t tell on photo but gave it a stunning metallic dark gray look....received many compliments! love it very pretty. good pigment works for 25th anniversary cake Shinny and chrome. This leaves such a fun gold color on food. Easy to apply and didn't rub off works as well as could be expected I can't decide if I like this or not. Pros - it is gold, and shiny. Cons - it's hard to aim and get just the right amount if you're going freehand. I liked it sprayed on fondant that I then cut with cookie cutters to ice Christmas cookies. I didn't like it as much sprayed directly on frosting on a cake - too sloppy. :) Sprayed white fondant with this to make it look like a pot.  Used a few coats to achieve real silver but it was great. Pretty disappointing. It didn't work well, the color was very pale and even with multiple layers didn't cover or make my food look gold. Loved it...made the waves on the \"ocean cake\" perfect...not to mention so easy I bought this to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. Very happy with the result because this is not a shiny or vibrant color. It is mat and it's perfect to recreate a metal look. Will buy again. I bought silver and gold colors to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. This is not a shiny bright gold or silver, it is mat in color. That makes it perfect for my horseshoe cookies. It takes a little practice to get this right but when you do, it's great. LOVE this product! I used it on a three layer rosette cake. Spraying a lot of silver at the bottom and slowly easing up toward the top for an ombre effect. The customer absolutely LOVED it and I had a ton of compliments on it as well. It truly gives a metallic effect without the odd taste! Rather pink and not red. Really cool spray.  Be sure that whatever your spraying is room temperature and not right out of the fridge otherwise the spray well kind a look dewy.  Use the spray on something that's already yellow for a better look .  You need several coats and the can isn't very big .  Yellow looks awesome for my husbands Notre Dame cupcakes !\n",

      "Update:\n",
      "I have also tried red  and it works great!  I got the frosting basically pink in color with food dye and then I sprayed over the top with red .  Didn't take a lot but man it was everywhere so do it outside or over a sink if possible.\n",

      "Update #2:\n",
      " I have now used black and It turned out awesome for my galaxy cupcakes!  Started with blue frosting ,  Sprayed a little bit of black , then painted on some luster dust! This Color Mist was disappointing -- it just looked like an odd purple, not black. Despite repeat applications, the color never appeared black. The extra sprays made it seep under the cake stencil, so it just became a purple mess. I was able to scrape away the extra purple/blackish color and repair the whipped cream frosting, but I regret trying this product -- so I caution you if you need a dark color. When I was ordering for cake-decorating, the Color Mist had seemed likely to be the easiest way to decorate the cake top with a stencil. As it turns out, my back-up plan -- colored sugar -- actually worked much better. I cannot recommend this Color Mist, but CK's sanding sugar (if you want a very fine sugar with color) and crystal sugar (which is larger than granulated sugar) are excellent decorating products. I gave this Color Mist 2 stars only because the sprayer worked. This spray is amazing. Previously I just used a light dusting of silver to give this look, but it wasn't the same.\n",
      "I recently used this on cream cheese mints and they looked AMAZING.  No added taste or stickiness. It doesn't look gold at all.  It turned my oreos muddy.  But my students loved the \"golden\" oreos. am waiting for this saturday to do cupcake and change the colors of the cupcake on top once i do my cupcake i change the color on top it going to look perfect and beautiful love it I used this on Christmas cookies and everyone raved about how nice it made them look. great color coverage.  I used it to paint on white chocolate mold.  It comes out in a nice even spray and the color is a matte gold for the surface I painted.\n",
      "We did not eat the white chocolate so I cannot say if it affected the flavor or not.\n",
      "The head in the photo is what we painted with the gold spray.  We used 1.5 cans of the spray because we had to spray it with a few coats to get full coverage and to prevent any drip marks.  It is very quick drying and we only waited a few minutes between coats. I sprayed this on Oreos to make them look like gold coins to take to a St Patty's Day Party (minimal effort, maximum cute). The effect was great but it did lend a little off-taste to the cookies, like a sugar alcohol flavor. Also, I was concerned that this would make my cookies soggy but I left them to dry for about an hour and they texture was fine. Perfect It smelled like rust-oleum. I had to spray the cake in the garage. After all that messing around the paint did not stick to the side of the cake. Gross I had so much fun covering my cake pops with this. You must be careful not to over spray. I used it on Christmas cookies, and everyone was full of praise Not as shiny and chrome as I was hoping.\n",

All they need is a dusting of the color--enough to distinguish one from the other.  Dries practically instantly, and doesn't affect the pill at all.

The adults thought they were a nice addition to the party and thought I bought the cookies with the glitter. Works well but do not use at close range or it will have a paint-like after taste. decorated some cupcakes and the kids loved them Amazing!! I made a crystal ball cake and sprayed it on for a \"glassy\" finish and it worked beautifully! No weird taste that I could detect and sprayed on smoothly.  I want to try some other colors now! Good product I love this product! I've went through several cans. It's great for adding shimmer to cookies, coloring pearls, painting small details on cakes. It doesn't go as far as I would like in terms of how much use you get out of can, but it's still a great product. can is so small --- unreal Ok I have a puppy and use this product to spray on the brown spots she leaves on my lawn. The color is perfect and I don't have to worry about environmental or health issues because it is edible! My lawn looks great. This stuff covered very well. I did not eat it, so I cannot say anything about that, but if you want a metallic looking gold on whatever it is you're making, this product really works. Great stuff... might I recommend using a small mask with this product as it will go into the nose and mouth when breathing while you are spraying it. The \"Violet\" is not a true violet, but instead, more of a navy blue.  Besides that fact, it is NOT good for use on cookies.  Unlike airbrushing, the spray goes everywhere and has a horrible, chemically smell and taste.  I had high hopes for this product, being the Wilton brand, but unfortunately I can not recommend this at all. I used this on cookies which i iced with white royal icing.  This gave the cookies a special pearly glow...not cheap, but it does look lovely. they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting...just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all... they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting...just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all... loved the product, worked perfect for a kids birthday party with cars. Shipped in plenty of time, good quality, excellent These colors rang very true, as Wilton colors always do. I have found that the easiest way to avoid using the whole container of black on one batch of frosting is to make chocolate frosting and then tint black. I haven't used the black yet.  I was hoping for something a little less cheap-orange-sherbet and a little more expensive-tangerine. Nice these colors are available year round, used the orange for a Harley Davidson cake. Came very quickly and perfect condition, very happy with transaction and product. good colors, easy to use TERRIBLE!  This changed the taste of the icing.  We had to toss the icing and make over.  Would NOT recommend.  Very disappointed. These arrived quickly and in good condition. I was using the violet to color sugar for a Lavender sugar scrub.\n",

      "few jabs of violet to get a decent lavender color. They look smaller than 1/2 ounce. It took much more gel to color the frosting than I thought it would. The colors are quite pastel and it takes some time to get them more vibrant. Its not a big deal, just an observation. Vivid amazing colors Daughter used it to make Playdough with grandson! Item as described. Fast shipping. Beautiful colors Nice set of food dyes. These are the best colors for coloring frosting. I've used Wilton brand for years and always get consistent colors. A little goes a long way (unless your want red, then you need a lot of dye). Not used yet but I know that the product is good. Tried it before Nice variety of colors to create the exact color you are needing. Colors for my royal icing....oh my love it Love these gel colors! Vibrant colors! Enjoy the gel--does not affect consistency or taste. Easy to use. Will purchase again. Love the colors. They are bright and vibrant. Worked great for my royal icing mix to make Christmas sugar cookies.  My skills as a decorator are lacking though.  LOL tis the season for baking. The colors are bright and very pretty. well done I have to admit that I bought this for Christmas and have not used it yet but since it is from Wilton I gave it 5 stars. It is supposed to be easier to use and use less because it is not a liquid. So will see. These work great!! We used for colored pancakes. Colors looked awesome. These gel colors are amazing bright. I have used them in desserts while my daughter uses them in DIY experiments. Great as always, Wilton! Good vibrant color! Very pleased. Like the liquid better Great colors! Nice set everything was great,thanks Nessie Worked great. I wasn't sure I would need it so had it as back up. Thought the icing could use a little pink tint. Instructions said use a toothpick. Thought more would be better. NOT. It turned into neon pink with 1/4 tsp. A little truly goes a long way. Next batch used the toothpick method and lovely shade light pink. Good quality colors.  Spreads evenly and is not clumpy great colors Great selection of colors. They all seemed very vibrant and you only need to use a small amount for intense color. Good quality that produces bright colors.  Consistency is like a gel not liquid. Exactly what I needed. not bad, I made a big mess though, was getting it out with toothpicks Great product! Never waters down my icing!! Good size, little goes a long way! Used for rock candy and the colors were very vibrant. Just a tiny drop of this food dye goes a LONG way. I add it to my cakes and cookies by dipping the tip of a toothpick in the dye and then stirring the toothpick in the dough. That's it. They come in individually sealed little screw top jars. Don't get the dye on your fingers because they stain. They are made in the USA. I use this for coloring macarons, and the quality is great. You only need a few drops to give rich color to a big bowl of batter, and the gel consistency (compared to liquid food coloring) is crucial for making macaron batter that does not become to runny. I've bought the same pack multiple times already and don't plan on changing products anytime soon! Wilton products are the best. Why wouldn't you put food coloring in a little jar with a top that you can pour out by drops? This top screws off and it's so hard to get just a small amount in a tiny 1/8th tsp. When one is coloring frosting, it is done gradually and this is too easy to end up dumping. Wilton should know better! Vibrant colors. Very pleased with this purchase. You only need a tiny amount to jazz the place up! Be careful not to overdo it! Just great - my wife loves it! Just what I expected Super thin and takes a TON to make something white. BUT it gets the job done. Excellent seller!  Excellent product! Worked great for making candy apples for my daughters birthday party. Used these to make icing for sugar cookies. Didn't take a whole lot of tint to make beautiful cookies. NExt up, rainbow layered cake. I used to color my icing and the colors are bright and fun! This seemed to brighten the whiteness of the buttercream which had a slight tint from the butter.  No additional taste, true buttercream flavor not affected. Overall, good product Perfect for coloring icing. Used this in a batch of icing and \"thought\" it would turn my icing white as is stated on the bottle, but it didn't.  I added more, little by little hoping to get more of a white icing and it didn't happen.  I will admit, I didn't want to dump the entire bottle in the icing and I was only making enough icing to frost 12 cupcakes (not a lot).  I did shake the bottle well prior to use and beat it well to mix it well into the icing.  I finally gave up and went with a different company and made different colors for my icing since I could not achieve the white color I was looking for.  I would not recommend this company for coloring and they do have a lot of additives in their products.  I would also not recommend this product because it could not achieve what was stated on the bottle - color my icing (white in my case). I baked a cake for my son's third birthday with a buttercream frosting, which, as we all know, often comes out yellow thanks to the butter. I put several drops into my double batch of frosting, and it did noticeably whiten. I will say the my frosting wasn't a perfect white, but I didn't need it to be, and I wanted people to know I'd made it from scratch, so this at the very least brightened the frosting beautifully and did not affect taste or smell. They work pretty well. This was nice and they work great Great Product Super concentrated.  Easy to use.  Love these. This was my first foray into gel food coloring. I use it to dye cookies, cake batter, and icings, which it works wonderfully for. You only need a tiny bit to get bold color (which doesn't fade in the oven) and it doesn't change the taste or texture of your baked goods. I would highly recommend this, especially if you've never used gel before. The difference is amazing. Be careful with it, though-- it's also quite good at coloring hands and counter tops! The food coloring works fine. Colors are great. I just wish they came in a squeeze bottle. Not only would it be less messy, but it'd be easier to measure how much color you're adding in case you want to recreate it. Love it Cute colors nice colours Ideal. Use for icing like you're supposed to, not other things.  This isn't a drop, it's a gel with a bit of a sour taste, somewhat messy unless I was doing it wrong (possible!).  I will buy the drops next time. The problem is not in the product. It's the light in your home. Colors appear differently in artificial light than they do in natural light (daylight). This happens to everything, not just food. It happens to clothing and even makeup. Purple colors are most affected by this. What looks like a pretty purple outside is going to look black inside the house.\n",

      "Thanks for reading this, I hope it helps. Nice!!! Great product for coloring granulated sugar! Put 1/2 cup regular white granulated sugar in a ziplock baggy then add a few drops color ( using toothpick) reseal the bag getting all the air out first, and squish by hand til color is blended! Saves a lot of money from buying colored sugar!! An easy kid friendly project too!! Great color intensity and no drying time needed!! I bought this to use as white paint to paint on fondant for cakes. It worked perfectly! A little goes a really long way. I don't see running out anytime soon. I love using this to whiten icing...... A must have for decorators... Thanks i found wilton colors very ssheap  special for me that a love make cakes Great selection of colors for cake decorating.  The bottles will go a long way. I am happy with this purchase. These are small tubs but you don't need much because the gel is so think. One dip of a small spoon and you have enough to color an entire cake! Easy to store because of there small size and no bad after taste. I love these colors. I use them for my fondant. The directions say to use a toothpick to color your icing/fondant. I tried that initially but because I always want such deep colors it took forever to do. So I started using a brush get more gel on the fondant then knead it in. I got deeper colors fast.  I suppose if you are looking for pastel you should use the toothpick method. These are gel so they don't spill. No mess--and I can be messy. Another terrible quality product from Wilton - why do they have a monopoly in the USA on cake decorating stuff? There are WAY better products out there. My mom used these colours to make my birthday cake. I went to have another piece 3 days later and the lovely lilac color had turned into a murky blue. The colours don't just change into another attractive colour they go into horrible dingy colours - supposing I had sold a wedding cake and it had changed colour before the day?! Don't risk it and don't waste your money on this terrible product. Don't buy their horrible stiff dry fondant either. Love this product, never will use anything else to color icing again. It doesn't thin the icing and the colors you can create with these basics are the best! I love my jerky. Great flavor love the taste it leaves on jerky Nesco jerky seasoning is AMAZING. I mix the seasoning and cure in about 2 tablespoons of seasoning and then add to my meat. The resulting jerky is AMAZING. just ok this seasoning is terrible waste of money We make Venison jerk all year round, good source of protein on ATV trips! We all love this spice seasoning.  Not too spicy, but just enough.  Arrived quickly. Way too expensive, but good product. This brand has the most variety of flavors i have used yet. i use a jerky gun made by the same company. There is a flavor for everyone in the family. I prefer mine hot n spicy but the maple bacon is to die for. i would recommend this brand for any jerky lover <3 did not get what is pictured and the box was squashed, I was very disappointed because it was a gift to someone. My husband used it with his deer meat.  It had a great taste and worked well.  He'd buy it again. Nesco jerky 3 pack has something for everyone. I have used this mix to make jerky with 93% ground beef. Higher quality beef better the result. The original and teriyaki are very good, just the right amount of heat and sweetness. The Hot and Spicy mix packs a nice hot punch with a mild sweetness. I prepare jerky in a dehydrator and finish with cold smoking for 2 hours. Smoking is what take good jerky and makes it extraordinary. I prefer this to the original mix from A.C. Legg. tastes good! works great! it taste alright Yummy Fair.  Save some $$$ and make your own with a soy/ BBQ sauce base and liquid smoke varieties.  There are a number of recipes online and ultimate cost is a lot less. I love this stuff.  It's great on its own or a good starting point to add additional spices.  I like to grind up some rosemary, fennel, garlic powder, cayenne, chipotle or cumin! way TOO Strong flavoring use more meat then what the recipe says then it is good This is excellent. Each pack makes two pounds of beef jerky. I also added smoked paprika, garlic powder and liquid smoke. Tastes great. Will buy again. Great Product TL:DR First off, why 3 stars and not 5... 1: Too much \"Original\" Flavoring, 3 packs for 6# of meat which makes up 25% of the flavorings. 2ndly: The teriyaki taste absolutely nothing like REAL teriyaki or even close to \"Teriyaki\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing wrong so to speak with the Original flavoring, it just too plain for me, like plain salted chips. Some of you enjoy that, and its your prerogative so go for it and enjoy!\n",

      "I use 2# of 20/80 ground beef per batch using the Plain Nesco Jerky gun included in my set, 3 clicks gives you nice 5\" strips which shrink down to 4ish.

I love this jerky seasoning the best thank you yummo Good seasoning.  Pretty generic, but a great starting point. Best seasoning I have used for jerky. Great flavor Great jerky seasoning plenty of flavor Sweet. Hard. Wood. Love it. Use it all the time for hamburger jerky. Taste great. I will keep buying this one. Great jerky spices.  With the variety pack, you can't go wrong when you try 'em all to see what you like best.  It also includes the curing powder for turn key jerky: Just mix with meat and dry!  I make double or triple batches and blend different packets to get jerky flavors in between.  Fair price too.  I'll be buying more Nesco. I really like this stuff, used it twice for jerky already.. exactly what it was supposed to be wonderful Love this sweet hardwood flavor!  Always comes out great. The ratio of salt has changed from the older version.  It's too salty.  I had some of the older version cure packages.  There was 2 teaspoons of ground salt in the package. The new package had 2 teaspoons of Kosher salt.  No wonder it was too salty!  The spice mix is excellent, just don't add all the cure salt package. Makes great jerky. fantastic flavors!! Loved them all!!\n",

      "& cheaper. :) The jerky made with the basic recipe is OK. I would suggest adding some additional spices if you would like more flavor. This is basic jerky made with a mixture of beef and pork. These seasonings are great. I think they're a bit pricey. The reason I make jerky is to save on costs. Paying an extra $1/lb just for seasoning isn't my thing. I won't by these again and will just mix up my own seasoning. I'm sure all of you have your own way of doing this. Myself, I prefer to get the leanest meat possible. Have used London broils, trimmed out all the tendons and fat and I do a double grind in my meat grinder. It's difficult to season the meat thoroughly and evenly, but the 2nd grind eliminates that for me. After the 1st grind, season the meat evenly, 1 lb at a time. Then run thru the grinder a 2nd time, which really mixes it up. Using the jerky gun, it spits out evenly the double ground meat and it dries very well.  I've never noticed one piece of meat having more flavor than another, thus eliminating under / over cures.  I hope this helps anyone trying for the 1st time.  Seasoning nonground strips of meat and drying is doable, but the meat will always be tough to chew and hard on ones teeth, perhaps even damaging is you pull too hard to tear off a piece to chew.  Being skeptic,  I used the jerky gun and much to my surprise the strips are very tender (thanks to the grinding) and safe for all ages and no damage to your teeth, false or real.  Once dried to your satisfaction, I bag mine in my foodsaver to keep out moisture and extend it's shelf life. Yes great product Great variety and taste. Best jerky I've ever had AND way cheaper than the store brands. good product With a little futzing around, you can make your own Burger-Jerky.  It tastes great and goes fast.  Fun, and since it is from chopped/ground beef, it is easy to eat.  A+ from me. This is my 3rd box.  Love the flavor.  Marinate meat for a full 24 hours before dehydrating. You'll be glad you did. Just what I expected. Always yummy. Love this seasoning. Taste great great Loved the favor! Very good seasoning to make my jerky This seasoning is great, not too salty As advertised. As advertised. Very good Jerky.  I made my first batch using eye of round and my nesco fd-1040 dehydrator.  Jerky went fast. Nesco original seasoning and cure worked well. I cured my eye of round, sliced 1/4 inch thick, for 3 hours. Dehydrated for 6 hours at 160 degrees to perfect leathery texture. Tasty seasoning--a little spicy for me, but just right for my husband!  Good product! Love the flavor Best jerky making product for easy ground beef beef jerky Can't beat this!! ugh. taste is a personal thing, but too salty and just off somehow. Original for the win! Made 8 lbs of ground beef jerky the other day and shared it at work, everyone was floored that I made it! Great recipe, easy to make, just don't let it get too dry on the dehydrator. Would buy this again, and have already recommended it to others. Also works well if you want to spice things up yourself. I've added a few Tbs of black pepper to a couple lbs that worked out well, and even added habanero to some. Probably wouldn't work so well if you added your own teriyaki, but hey, maybe I'd be wrong. This is great jerky seasoning and curing kit  I tried the spicy first.  and Yes it is.  Mixes easily into meat. good tasting Great flavor This stuff is great! Follow the directions on the pack and pop your meat in the dehydrator, smoker, whatever. This is the best tasting pre-made mix i've used. I still like homemade jerky best, but this jerky seasoning is probably the next best thing and, if you're willing to do the work, a heck of a lot cheaper than buying jerky from stores. my husband loves this type I got it for him and he says way better then store bought so we will be coming back for more because he really loves it and he is a very picky guy :) shipping was fast and packaging was amazing even our cats think the box was amazing my order came in lmaoo I have been making beef jerky for about 20 years and this is the only product I will purchase. Everyone says that my beef jerky is better than any other jerky they have tasted (I do add other ingredients to my marinate).  I would never consider purchasing another product. Every year I make beef, and sometimes venison, jerky for gifts and everyone looks forward to it. They immediately rip open the packages and start eating it up! Great, have used in the past, my families favorite! great flavor I love the way these make my Jerky taste. This flavor the Sweet Hardwood is my fav. I jerky usually venison and turkey and bother turn out so good. I just add black and cayenne pepper to raise or lower heat value. They are  a huge hit with friends. The sweet hardwood is just that, nice subtle sweet and smokey taste. Another think i will do if i want more smokiness is to add a few drops of liquid smoke. I have yet to make a batch of bad jerky with these seasoning. great product as described, everyone loves my Jerky Best flavor, only thing I use for my venison. great stuff I bought this to use with sliced beef (rather than the ground jerky version) and so far have only used the terriyaki flavor.  It is very tasty and even better than store bought jerky.  I can't wait to use the other flavors. I will definitely buying again. Our favorite brand and flavor great flavor Very good flavor, and a bargain for the price. This is the best jerky spice we have found.  However, if you are allergic to monosodium glutamate do not buy this. Honestly, the Sweet Hardwood flavor is absolutely delicious when used with deer. Have not used yet but i am sure it will work out just fine. Great variety pack of seasoning to try out when making jerky!  I like the original and teriyaki best.  Comes with the salt to cure it too.  Nice set w nice variety from a company that I trust. This is my go-to jerky seasoning for my ground beef jerky.  I've got a complete Nesco dehydrating system and this was the very first seasoning I ever tried.  It's changed it's packaging over the years, but it's always the same high quality flavorful taste we've come to expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the latest change to packaging, the cure and the seasoning are in two separate plastic pouches joined in the middle.  This is such a huge improvement over the old separate, foil-lined paper pouches.  With this packaging now the seasoning doesn't clump and form blocks that need a spice grinder to break apart.  So much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is amazing.  Everyone who's ever tried my jerky says they like it when they taste it at first but then each of them has come up to me later and told me again how incredible it was.  This stuff literally makes you crave more.  It's evil in the best kind of way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've probably made a couple hundred pounds of jerky over the years and this has made up more than half of it.  I'll continue to buy it and win people over.  You really can't go wrong with the Original!

      "Nesco Original jerky marinade is superior to Nesco's Teriyaki jerky marinade.  The Original is bolder, has more flavor, and the hint of authentic smokey flavor and is just right, something that's missing in Nesco's Teriyaki offering.  Also, I would advise using only half the cure packet or  your jerky will come out way too salty. Just finished another batch of Jerky using this Nesco product.  I made some into Hamburger Jerky and some with sliced mean.  Love them both.  I would highly recommend this product for making Jerky that everyone loves. Sweet hardword is ok. Not sure I really like a sweet jerky. great product havent used looks great Great starter flavors for beginners.  Just remember to only use the salt right before dehydrating. I bought the sampler kit and the original is the only one that I really enjoyed. It is so good it is hard to describe. I use this for ground beef jerky and 10lbs of jerky is gone in 2 days with this where as with the other flavors it lasts about 3 days. I used one package so far, the original seasoning.  Soaked the beef overnight in the fridge then dehydrated the pieces.  Got raves about it.  Wasn't too 'hot'.  I don't care for hot type flavors so it was just right.  There is a package that looks like it would be way to hot for me, so that one will get donated...LOL.  Makes mixing up flavors on my own a lot easier and a lot more predictable.  Highly recommend. Coworkes and guests LOVE this particular seasoning with the ground turkey in the dehydrator. Nesco does a great job of season and curing agent balance. Not to saltyand never lacking flavor. It worked ok to make jerkey Really good tasting flavors, I haven't even used all of them yet. For the best results marinate the hamburger over night. great price fast delivery just gross make your own The spicy flavor has a lot to be desired , yes it was somewhat spicy but the good taste was missing and was it ever salty ? They need to go easy on the sodium , a lot of my friends thought. The same ! It tastes too similar to the original flavor.  either this should be called \"orginal\" or the original should be called \"cracked pepper and garlic\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Its not bad, just not what i wanted. Love it We love this flavor! I was introduced to this brand when I bought the jerky gun. It had 5 packs in with it. A simple process that gives plenty of flavor! A must have choice for all jerky makers! Great Product! Great product.  Have ordered in the past. This is my favorite flavor and is what everyone is used to. Have tried other brands when I could not find this in the store and regret it. It is a mild flavor and is good to use when making jerky or sticks. All NESCO flavors are great, as family likes the Teriyaki flavor. For best results would recommend letting set overnight after mixing, covering with plastic wrap in refrigerator. Would also recommend using beef at least 85% or less. It will come out dry, if you don't. Using the NESCO dehydrator, it runs around 165 degrees. Rotate the trays as the lower trays dry faster, and turn the jerky as it dries. The round NESCO dehydrator is not efficient at making best use of tray space when making straight lengths of jerky, but they now make a new square model, recently purchased, and has adjustable temperatures. Added a small amount of water, makes it mix easier. This is my, and my wife's, favorite flavor. Each pack works for one pound of raw ground beef. The garlic is noticable without being overpowering, and the pepper adds a nice touch. You should know how easy it is to use, just mix the dry ingredients with the ground beef, add the salt packet (we use about 2/3 of the salt), put the meat mixture in the jerky gun, press and dehydrate. good stuff Absolutely the best & easiest way to make jerky!! Great taste. With it. And its great not to salty just right. Easy to use at a good price. Nesco Teriyaki Jerky Spice came highly recommended, bu is far from the flavor of Jack Links teriyaki packaged jerky that I love. Is not as sweet or tasty as Jacks. Maybe extra brown sugar and soy sauce added may help. Will prob go for the peppered next time. And this is TOOOOO expensive to not be perfect. will continue to use, all great flavors! Very convenient, good flavor. A little strong so I don't always use the whole flavoring packet. And full of MSG, so not something to use for everyday jerky unless you don't care about that. kids all rave about the jerky !!! This is the best non spicy jerly mix we have tried.  We used it on deer meat. great Great seasoning. A must if you like preparing your own home made beef jerky in your Nesco dehydrator.  Buy lean ground beef like 93% lean or grind your own if you own a meat grinder, mix with these ingredients and use the jerky gun with the wide nozzle that will produce nice ribbons of beef.  You are in for some great jerky in no time.  3 pounds of ground beef will yield about 1-1/3 pounds of dried jerky in about 6 hours in the dehydrator at 160 degrees with one flip of the beef ribbons half way through the dehydrator sequence. Perfect for making jerky. Use this stuff all the time. great  taste Great product, quite tasty.  If you're going to be eating your beef jerky within a week, you can avoid using all the cure and sub in salt.  Refrigerate it, and should last you at least 2 weeks. Good stuff Easy to make recipe, and tastes great! The best jerky spice I have found!  Tastes great! Easy recipe! This came in a 10 ct variety pack that I ordered from Nesco's website.  This is seriously chili flavored, not buffalo wing flavored - not even close.  It's not even a good chili flavor - it's like imitation chili flavor.  Also, I used this seasoning with ground beef in the Nesco jerky gun, and it prevented the beef from binding and caused the strips to break apart while ejecting the meat onto the rack.  Very difficult to work with.  I'm SO glad I didn't get stuck with a whole box - ruining a pound of meat was bad enough. gone This is the best flavoring you can get anywhere, I make alot of jerky & this is the best of the best. My wife thinks this is too spicy.  So we double the recipe add one of these and one of the regular jerky seasoning.  She loves it! It's now her quick go to for jerky seasoning. good deal for first time dehydrator user. I have never used this cure before and was surprised how easy it was to use.  I will definitely order this again. No way would I put the vast majority of the ingredients in these 'spice'  packs in my body..  As you know the list of the amount of anything in a product starts with the item it contains the most of and then the next most etc.  Try this for heart healthy,: Dextrose, sugar,salt,spices (doesn't say which ones) hickory smoke flavor, MSG, hyrolyzed soy protein, dehydrated onion,  dehydrated garlic,less than 2% of caramel color (what the heck for??), silicon dioxide and calcium silicate (anti-caking).  Then they list Cure ingredients:- salt (like they need more) and sodium nitrite (0.62^).\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I'm concerned, this product should either come with a warning that it's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely.  I'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk.  Don't know if it's worth bothering to send back but I sure won't be using it. Great for the beginner or if you just want to whip up some jerky for the kids. But for an experienced connoisseur of cured meats, it may be a bit so-so for your friends at the hunting lodge or deer camp. A bit too much salt and not enough flavor for a real enjoyable nibble, this, for understandable reasons; too much salt/cure is better than not enough. None-the-less you could maybe cut it with celery salt and tone it down a bit. As aforementioned, this is a great product for the beginner....can't miss if used according to instruction... Whenever there is London broil on sale, this is the seasoning that helps to transform it into some of the best beef jerky ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "We marinate our meat in this overnight in the refrigerator.  I use a little of the 'cure' to keep any fat from turning rancid, but honestly it does not last long enough to be an issue if the kids can get at it. Bought this for my hunter-boyfriend. We broke up shortly after. I think he got all he needed from me. I bought an extra set and now I'm pretty content, too. I have tried different flavors and I always come back to the Original. Main reason being it serves as a great base or starting point for adding your own tweaks. Sometimes I add a bit of cayenne, garlic, ground pepper, terriaki, or some other flavor I want to try. Been using this brand for several years and yet to disappoint. this is the 2 nd time i have ordered this product. good flavors and variety to choose . would buy again This is really easy to use and tastes great! The kids had a fun time mixing it all up! We bought two boxes. Line your dehydrator though because the hamburger grease makes an awful mess! At least line the bottom This is some great seasoning, but if you use the full pack of cure salt per pound, it is VERY salty. For me, it was just barely edible. I read some other reviewers saying that they only use 1/2 a pack of cure per pound and I'm going to try that on the next batch. I keep my jerky in the fridge and it's usually gone within a couple weeks, so the reduced cure salt shouldn't affect preservation. I have been making this jerky for 15 years +. Made it for the Carriers at the local Post Office. I Settled on 15-20 percent fat Ground Beef. No fat beef is tastless. I would buy  in 5 pound increments then have the butcher break it up into 1 pound pieces. 1 baggie spice and perservative each per lb of ground beef. Some liked it hot so I added a tblsn+ or - red pepper flakes per pound. Make 5 pounds or more each time. Do not run this through a mixer. Comes out hard and rubber like. Hand Mix then place in jerky gun. I use a Large gun with twin head cutting down on time. Cook anywhere from 8 to 10 hours depending on the outside temp. I use Excalibur 9 tray unit set too 160 degrees. Let it cool and bag it up then refrigerate. This comes out so tasty and tender even your toothless relatives can chew/eat this witout any problem. I am one of those toothless wonders. Chew this no problem. Good luck my friends. Great spices for just starting out in jerky making. The whole family enjoys home made jerky. Every flavour is great. Good flavoring, but more for ground meat you form into jerky than it is for thinly sliced muscle. It worked for the latter, but was a smidge on the salty side. I followed the instructions.  It was very tasty but salty.  Next time I will use more meat per packet. Will buy again\n",

      "3/10 made it again.  Added 1/2 cup of srirachi .  Yummy Good product, great seasonings, applies well, gives a great aroma, tastes great.\n",
      "Well worth the money I paid for it. My son told me someone at his work used these- had allot of venison so tried it.. Can't decide which was my favorite. Went back and ordered the 25 pack so I could also have the Pepper/garlic flavor. Better than some venison jerky we have purchased . i have tried various jerky spice premixes and i tend to like the the nesco brand best. i make jerky at least 1 or 2 times monthly. the spice mix comes in a two-package mix. one with the spices and the other with the cure (salt). the only thing that i have an issue with this brand (and with many the others also) is that i find the jerky has too much salt for me. so i only use a 1/2 - 3/4 bag of cure when making a batch. i feel that this is safe because i normally eat the jerky within three weeks. hence, i do not need the cure for a long-term consumption. Love all the  4 flavors in this box - have used prior to this purchase. Will continue to order and recommend Everyone in our family loves this seasoning the best. We have tried the others but always come back to the original Nesco. I idem is great. I love the taste it makes, of the food. It is so good, I want to reorder it. This seasoning is great! I've purchased this several times and use it to make ground beef jerky with my NESCO dehydrator (the square white one). It is always a hit wherever I bring it and everyone loves this flavor! While I'm sure I could try to find my own seasoning to match this or come close, getting all the mixed seasonings and the curing packets for this price make it a great deal! Love this product! Started using it probably 10 or 15 years ago when I purchased my first Nesco dehydrator. We love all the Jerky Works flavor but the original is my personal favorite. I have used the products from Nesco for several years! I make jerky and send to my sisters every year at Christmas time. As always this product is great! I have been using it every year for several years and we think it is the best! this package a complete surprise after some thought. I originally believed this to be one flavor but the 3 that came where good. I've been buying this for year  direct from the manufacturer.  Amazon is about  the same price but has free shipping so you save money.  This is a great spice.  Works best with venison.  Beware of the ho variety as it is VERY hot.  If you are using ground beef to make beef stick jerky try the pepperoni or fajita flavor.  I still like this one (original) the best. Love making beef jerky and the spice packages are very easy to use. We enjoy all the different flavors that this pack comes with too. I've tried other name brands but this one is the best flavor and doesn't cost a lot. We tried all 4 flavors for making venison jerky.  Each flavor is excellent and provides a burst of taste.  Each packet makes 1 lbs. Makes wonderful jerky with the nesco dehydrator.  How much water you use though will greatly affect flavor if you marinate.  I plan to try several different amounts of water with varying meat sizes.  Too much water and you don't get any flavor. More flavors and different package configurations needed.  I usually buy the regular and pepperoni by the 25 count bag.  Nesco makes lots of flavors and package sizes and configurations for multi flavors.  I wish Amazon carried more selection Bought a bunch of these in different varieties. Loved the selection and ease. Cuts down prep time more than half since the seasoning is pre-measured for 1lb of ground meats. Liked the Varity of different spices plus there perfect for 1lb of any kind of ground meat. Cuts prep time in half or more. This stuff is awesome and all is inclued to make great jerky.  Qiuck and easy it's all in the box compact with good instructions.  Nesco is the way I bought the 6 pak to try out. We liked it, it has a good flavor, but we thought it was a bit salty. Next time, I will probably use half of the salt mixture. I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to season 3 mix packets for 3 pounds of beef. The heat was just right for us - not too hot but a bit of zing to it. Very tasty - would recommend to others. I have been buying jerky for years so I now decided to start making my own.  This is so easy and great.  If I thought this was going to be so easy I would have done this long ago.  Just the right taste and so easy to do Warning. Contains MSG and nitrates. Those wanting to make real jerky, not a chemical cocktail should avoid this. Buy from online spice sellers or a local spice shop. Good variety pack. Easy to use. I do recommend it. ( But It does have msg) My Family loves it. I use this jerky cure for making ground beef jerky. I like the flavor of the spice; however, I feel that the spice mix has enough salt that I don't need the full salt/cure packet. I usually use 3 pounds of ground beef with two packets of spice mix and one packet of salt/cure and it is way salty/spicy enough. This is our favorite flavor of all the different flavors by Nesco. We bought the variety pack and decided this was our favorite. We bought this product so we could try the different flavors that Nesco had to offer before we bought larger quantities and found that we did not like it. I am glad we bought this because we found that we like the original and the pepper garlic the best, but that is us. I love jerky and enjoy making it myself.  This spice tastes good.  I actually use twice as much when making my jerky.  Isn't too overpowering.  Highly recommend for jerky-making lovers. If you make your own jerky (and you totally should), get this variety kit.  I have made several varieties from this kit, and I have gotten compliments on each one every time I made it.  My favorite is the teriyaki! My family loves all the different spices used in these Jerky Spice packages.  Can't go wrong when making Jerky.  Always yummy. I decided to make my own jerky and couldn't believe how easy it is with a dehydrator.  By using the JERKY SPICE mix, I couldn't go wrong with the great taste!! Very good spices but too salty......wish they could make a spice packet with less salt....but the taste was great other than that. because with all these great reviews, I expected to LOVE this stuff - and I just don't!\n",

      "I've been making jerky for years now, and switched to ground beef jerky about 2 years ago because the dentist said it would be easier on my husband's teeth, so I bought the LEM Jerky Cannon and got busy.  Using a liquid-based seasoning makes for a very tasty jerky, but it squirts a lot of liquid out while extruding the ground beef onto the drying trays, so I thought I'd take the easy way out and try a prepackaged mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jerky Cannon came with one packet of a spice mix and we thought it was pretty good.  When looking to replace that, I came across all the good reviews of this Nesco product, so I went ahead and ordered the 18 pack.  I got 5 pounds of 88% lean beef, mixed in 5 packets of the mix, extruded, turned on the dehydrator, and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few hours later, it was dry.  I've also found that the jerky tastes better the next day, but I couldn't resist trying it right out of the dehydrator.  I found it pretty bland, but figured it would be better after being refrigerated and let the flavors meld.  Nope! Still very bland and with a bit of an \"odd\" taste I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I mixed up some soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and red pepper flakes and coated each dried strip of jerky with that, then put it back into the dehydrator for an hour to dry it all out again.  This is at least tasty enough to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure WHAT I'm gonna do with the other 13 packets of spice mix, but I sure won't bother to use it in my jerky again.  I'm giving 2 stars because it's not HORRIBLE, it's just not GOOD, or at least, it's not to our tastes.  I won't be buying it again. I love this Original flavor jerky spice!  Also the Hot and Spicy. They are my two favorites. I mix with lean ground beef, and it's the best. My friends and family can't believe I made it!  I've tried other brands, but Nesco makes the best flavored! I love the Hot and spice because it's a little less sweet than the regular. I still add some cayenne pepper and black pepper to kick it up!!! Nesco Jerky spice is as far as I'm concerned the only one to purchase.  Love the original flavor the best. I love the flavor of these, but found that it's best dispersed if mixed in the ground beef using a food processor.  There's two (attached) packets: one with flavoring/spices and another that is curing salt.  For me, I use a little over half of the curing salt, but never the full amount.  The jerky is too salty otherwise.  I always keep the finished jerky in the fridge anyway, so I don't need as much salt in mine. I like this variety pack bc it allowed me to find my favorites. I really like the hot and original so I need to find somethin to do with this nasty pepper flavor! :/ This is a good flavored jerky, I used it with strip beef and my family eats it right up.  It is delicious without being over powering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of peppery which we liked, but if you don't like black pepper, you probably won't like this one. This an excellent spice for homemade jerky, but it wasn't quite hot enough for me. My wife prefers this spice the way it is, so we made a regular batch for her and it was quite tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it even hotter we added powdered habanero peppers that we make from the garden. Man-o-man was it hot. But I loved it and my friends loved it. Compared to the regular this product has a strong peppery taste which I don't mind at all. Keep the flavors coming Great taste for a home made treat. These rubs have just enough flavor in them. Would definetly buy them again after we try to make a few rubs from home! ;) We use ground turkey with this jerky spice.  Love getting this from Amazon.com because you can get this in a larger package.  The flavor is very good.  We add some hot, spicy seasoning to this original flavor sometimes and it's quite good.  It's great all on it's own, but if you want to add a little heat, that pairs well with it !  Good, tasty stuff ! I've used all of the flavors in this pack and every one of them makes really tasty jerky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having curing salt along with flavoring gives your jerky a real 'professional' taste, and directions are easy to follow. I love these packets, the flavor is good in each of them. They make the process of jerky making very simple. I normally use deer meat and I like a little heat to mine. I always add extra cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper with all of these packets when combining to ground meat. I do use ground meat to make jerky using a jerky gun to form it into shape. By doing this, you get flavor throughout the entire pieces of jerky. The best thing about these packet compared to others that I have used is the cure also comes in individual packets that are pre-measured. Also, it is not too salty like some other jerky spices that I have used that make you measure out the cure from a bulk packet. Bottom line, I will order these again when I run out. I prefer the Nesco Original Flavor as it packs more of a flavor punch than this.  I do like this flavor but it just seems it should be a little stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another note you should be aware that this product contains MSG in the cure packs.  Since a lot of people want to get away from MSG you may want to look elsewhere if that's a problem for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're dead set on Teriyaki and don't mind the MSG, give this stuff a try.  Otherwise try their Original flavor or go with another brand that doesn't include MSG.  I'll be looking around at other brands going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "-D We tend to add our own spices/peppers, etc. to get the exact flavor we want, but the base flavor is pretty good on its own.  I like to use the Original, with about a cup of Jalapenos per pound of meat, and maybe some chipotle to adjust the flavor a bit.  A bit of BBQ sauce mixed in can be a nice change of pace, as well. Quick and easy review: Very good for dehydrated jerky spicing.\n",
      "A variety of flavors from sweet to spicy.\n",
      "Good value for the money. We have made a lot of Jerky and shared it widely... even sent some to SW Asia (Afghanistan and Iraq) ... it traveled well and was always appreciated. It works, is reasonably priced for what you get and well worth the time and effort. You can't ask for much more... If you want to get a variety to see which jerky flavor you like for the future, then this is the way to go. To me they all tast good to great. The taste is a little less than expected. I really prefer to mix up my own. Soy sauce, ginger, brown sugar, honey, etc. the produce was easy to use all you have to do is follow the direction that come on the package and when you go to make what you want with it comes out very well Have had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's tried my jerky!  So easy to mix, can be used with ground meat or strips, and doesn't require a lot of fuss or instructions.  Haven't tried the other flavors yet, cause I'm still hooked on the original!  Highly recommend! This is a good tasting Jerky Spice, the cure is too salty for me so I use 1/2 the package without any issues.\n",
      "I have used it on Ground Chicken, turkey, pork. Used it on thinly cut chicken breasts, thin cut pork chops, tuna and salmon. I ordered this and the Cracked Pepper and Garlic flavors, both worked out well but I liked the original more.  I used this as exactly as I could to the volume of weight and it did seem a little extra salty - I know Jerky is supposed to be salty of course but if I had one and only one complaint it would be regarding that.  Next time I'll try limiting some of the salt and see how that goes, but either way I do recommend this product it's very easy to use and tastes good. Oh, I used this both for ground beef (using a jerky gun) and for flank steak pieces.\n",

I'm not the best person to review this item.  I have no other piping gel to compare to.

      "It was easy to work with, but it's not overly thick, so if you are writing with it, use a tip with a small hole because it comes out a freely.  Not sure how to put it-as I said 'new to decorating' this product  ( Wilton Piping Gel, 10-Ounce), is truely a very ghood product, today i tried it for the first time , wanted to do some writing with <royal icing>, on a cake ,as i am still learning  an\n",
      "and lines and curves were not easy to do ,alwayes came out sloppy  and ugly ,till  i used the wilton piping gel , half a tea spoon in a cup of royal icing  made it perfect , had no trouble\n",
      "at all ,it was easy ,smooth and beutiful, i regret that i got only one pack, promised myself to buy more next time. highly recommended. love this stuff and use it to create water droplets and fountains etc great Looked very pretty tinted blue as water on the cake, but didn't taste all that good. Amazing for GUMPASTE I used this as a sort of glue to put glitter on edible snowflakes and it worked great Wife loves this piping gel because it makes the piping work much easier, flows better and  makes a professional  outcome.  She also prefers it over gum glue in some instances. Makes fondant pieces sticks better, there is no sliding like when using alcohol or him glue. Lasts forever. Used it as glue for fondant pearls. Worked like a charm. This did not have the consistency that it normally does when purchased in the store.  Possibly an older batch but with a little work I can probably use it. This product is just perfect to use as a \"glue\" when I have to attach fondant items to fondant or to buttercream cake/cupcakes. I highly recommend this product for this purpose or even to color to use for writing on cake. Used it it to adhere fondant to a cake.  Worked well and didn't affect the flavor of the cake at all. I probably will order tubes in the future. This was perfect for my project while I was learning. Quality is always there on Wilton products. You can count on them. I won't say this is the best coffee in the world; because I have yet to try them all and everyone's tastes differ.  However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!  There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word of caution though.  Drink this at your own risk.  It is very hard to go back to \"normal\" coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods.  Enjoy! Thought this coffee was terrific. But, the a.count order was\n",
      "Such smaller than attendances. I wish the amount was bigger. I received  a box as a gift and was surprised by the  flavor, medium-bodied and smooth. No bitterness, this coffee was well balanced and well, comforting :) Enjoyable on a nice sunny morning but equally satisfying on a rainy day. A great gift for coffee connoisseurs! Very salty and didn't taste as fresh as unsalted one. I prefer Virginia Diner Gourmet. As described but not as large as I have ordered from other sites.. great The best of all peanuts!  Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - usually enough salt, but sometimes skimpy and sometimes not enough blistered jumbo peanuts.  I won't buy any other brands of Virginia Peanuts after these.  The price is well worth the product! Killer peanuts. Huge size, great taste, lightly salted. We like The Peanut Shop and Costco Kirkland Peanuts. In a grocery store trip pinch, Planter's Dry Roasted. These are better than all. As delicious as a Virginia peanut can get.  ALL GONE! Tastes good but they are not large -  just regular + few large + few tiny. Tasty Great product!  Fresh taste!  Regular purchaser since finding them! I have been looking for peanuts that don't have preservatives or other garbage on them.  Several months ago I found peanuts from Virginia (Parker's Peanuts) in the local store and decided to try them and we loved them.  Just peanuts and salt.  No chemicals or preservatives.  I had no idea Virginia peanuts were so amazing.  Best peanuts we ever had.  They ran out of the Parker's so I decided to try this brand and these are also fantastic!  Highly recommend. I love peanuts but these were NOT GOOD! I threw them out. I am a consumer, no one paid me, I bought all the peanuts with my money with no promos.  Writing review as I was so surprised by the Hubs' bland taste.  Ordering another Feridies right now.  No, zero affiliation with any of these brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste & Value:\n",
      "Feridies: 5 stars, expensive but worth it\n",
      "Hubs:  2 stars, 2 star taste, 2 star value.\n",
      "Planters: 4 stars, 3 star taste, 5 star value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feridies:  Crunchy, excellent taste, smell, aftertaste.  Essentially $23 for 40 oz can, 58 cents per oz.  Have consumed 4 cans over past 6 weeks.\n",
      "Hubs:  Crunchy, bland, no soul, not much flavor.  No Prime either, can't be returned.  These may look as good as Feridies, but the tastes are not close.  Since Hubs only sells it on Amazon as 2 can box, $46 wasted.  58 cents per oz.  But I ate 2 oz and don't even want to eat the rest. Sorry, to those who gave 5 stars to this product.  Not to me.  Debated 2 stars or 3 stars.  But since I don't even want to eat the rest of my 78 oz....\n",
      "Planters:  Not that crunchy, decent flavor, decent smell, not much aftertaste.  Price for 6 can box fantastic.  $18 for 6 cans, 96 oz.  19 cents per can.  These are ok to good peanuts.  Give 4 stars because of value. Just received my first can today.  I wanted to compare them with my favorite Virginia peanuts from Royal Oak I received yesterday.  I had them open side by side.  Feridies peanuts are saltier, but not to me objectionably so.  Their flavor is as good as Royal Oak, but no better.  The size of Feridies peanuts are SMALLER than the Royal Oak.  Among the Royal Oak peanuts are a number that can truly be considered \"extra, extra\" large.  I didn't find one in the Feridies can that could match that description.  Of course even Costco brand makes the same claim to size and they aren't.  I wonder if there actually is an official grading system for size.  I doubt it.  Both are crunchy but in a different way.  The Royal Oak peanuts are blistered while the Feridies are not.  Yet both are crunchy.  Taste wise they are both the same which makes sense since they are both cooked in peanut oil.  In fact many Virginia grown peanut brands are not.  Others use cheap soybean oil to cook their peanuts.  The heads of those companies should be taken out and shot, at least in my opinion.  I give Feridies peanuts four stars while I give Royal Oak fiver stars.  Why?  Because Royal Oak is cheaper by a few bucks per can.\n",
      "\n",
      "1/21/2018  I now notice that Feridies is a couple of dollars per can cheaper than Than Royal Oak.  However, the latest two cans i received of the Feridies contain smaller peanuts than ever before.  Yes, small nuts have a different bite than the larger ones.  Well, back to Royal Oak. great peanuts but holy crap 40 oz is a lot The best there is. This was hilarious, I didn't pay attention to the size online. They are huge. And amazing. They are a \"dry\" peanut, so very crunchy - PERFECT for what I wanted. I keep them at work for my friends that have medical issues or forget to eat. They're universally loved. The best available. Very crisp. Well salted The biggest peanuts ever and so so crunchy. Not too salty either I cannot express vehemently enough how yummy these peanuts are!  They are so well salted, with some kind of delicate, finely ground salt, that when I crave a salty snack these are my go to.  The peanuts are fat and almost sweet, they are so very flavorful.  I've trued many brands of peanuts before, but I can't get enough of these.  I buy them over and over and have turned other peopke on to how wonderful they are. Yummy! Disappointed, gave to critters. Love these. Crunchy, tasty, wonderful. great item. These are the old-fashioned style of Va. peanuts, lightly roasted, large and full of flavor.  If you like brown roasted Planters, don't buy these.  And don't leave negative feedback if you buy these and they aren't roasted as much as you like.  They are not supposed to be.  These are perfect, the way Williamsburg and other Va. peanuts used to be before they went national and overroasted their peanuts to sell to the Planters buyers. Unique flavor. Rate this peanuts as okay. Will not purchase again. They're great! Best peanuts in the WORLD!! I highly recommend this product. I was looking for GMO peanuts and Feridies fit the bill. The fact that they are perfectly roasted and taste better than \"The Peanut Shop\" or other brands of Virginia peanuts is a bonus. Highly recommend! Very good large, crunchy, Virginia`s!! Super sized and super crunchy with a ton of flavor. Another quality product I would buy over and over. EVERYBODY LOVES THESE PEANUTS...SAVING ONE CAN FOR CHRISTMAS BAKING Just trying to find the best Peanuts I could and happened upon these and I have to say \"they are great\" I will order my second can as soon as I finish this review. Excellent product and it is a huge can. I mean you can stick your fist into it. No one complained, but neither was anyone impressed with these nuts. The very best peanuts are Virginia peanuts. They are large and lightly slated. They are absolutely delicious. What a healthy snack. My favorite peanuts. I love them.  Wish I could have them all the time!!! This is stupid that I have to add more words. We have tried most of the Virginia peanuts out there and my wife and I agree that these are the best available. They are a perfect match of crunchiness and salt and it's hard not to eat just a handful of them. They're great when watching any type of sports or at any kind of party. You won't be disappointed! See's Candies is a well-known California chocolate company, now with stores and distribution throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.\n",
      "Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box. Was stale and some of the chocolate was white. Arrived in good condition.  It was a gift and recipient enjoyed the candy and shared it with friends.  I'm a big fan of See's candy.  Very tasty.  I love the chocolate flavors and the fillings are always good.  I even eat the coconut one; I don't usually like coconut. See Candy is great Perfect as always.  The most delicious chocolates around! Great Chocolates that only Californians use to know about.   Always good Love it but over priced Good taste. Good variety. Who doesn't love see's candy?  Right?  no one.  Growing up in California we had this all the time.  I have to mail it to my friends and family out of state so they too can enjoy this wonderful candy. Having Amazon ship it for me makes it so easy.  If you have not tried it please so.... the milk chocolate Bordeaux  is the by far, hands down, make you wanna slap someone, best candy that has ever been invented ever.  And I have 50 plus years of candy eating experience so I would honestly say that I am an expert in this field. Sees candy cures depression and speeds healing of any illness !! This is by far my favorite candy ever. The quality is unsurpassed and I order it every Christmas for my special friends and family. great candy! YUM can't go wrong with See's! See's is my hubby's favorite. We have one in town but I wasn't able to get there in time for Valentine's day 2015 so I ordered the 2 lb. here. I was pleased with the price and it shipped in a day. However my husband noticed after eating a few pieces some of them didn't seem to live up to standard. We turned the box over and it was dated 2014. Bad form, will not purchase from here again. The best candy you can buy, cost ore but well worth it. Try the peanut brittle, even if, you don't like peanut brittle, you will be wanting more. bought as a gift, these candies were enjoyed by the whole family. nice almost nothing better than See's.  This chocolate is so yummy and the price is right for this product right here on Amazon.  Especially if you are a Prime Amazon member and can find it right here.  So easy.  Then just sit back and wait for the mailman. What can I say - it's See's candy and they haven't changed in all these years - except for the PRICE!  This is a LOT of money to pay for a box of chocolates!  So - you had better love the person you are buying it for (including yourself) to want to spend that much on a single layer box.  They're good - but once a year is enough unless it's someone VERY special! In my memory See's are the best, but this one is Not as good as I remember it to be some who.  I would not get it again at this price. Ordered these for a gift. Not all the See's chocolates had an option for gift wrapping but these did so that's what we went with. While I can't comment on the freshness of the product since we'll never see them they shipping was super quick. Very glad it made it there sooner rather than later. Was supposed to arrive on the 17th via PRIME but actually arrived on the 14th... how this is possible I'm not sure. Did they wrap it up and hand deliver it? lol Sees has wonderful candy. So worth cheating on your diet for. If you get this item for a gift, don't share it. Hide it from every body else it is too good. See's is the best!!!!!!!!!! This was a gift for my daughter and her friend, who live in Florida. No see's store there, so they really appreciate it!!!!!! This is good honest tea. I'm a big fan of English breakfast tea, and this tea tastes amazing!!! This tea has excellent flavor. It is good, but it is still tea - ron swanson I gave up coffee a few years ago and had been looking for a good morning tea that I can take to work and give me a good wake up kick of caffeine.\n",
      "  this english breakfast tea has such a great taste to it and is of such a high quality. I can't recommend it highly enough. absolutely love this tea. average Love this brand of English Breakfast tea.  Happy to see I can buy it on Amazon and get free shipping. Great tea and fast delivery. Tea is good. The leafs are nice and full and the taste is full bodied. Not as strong as Irish Breakfast tea but none the less. If you are an Earl Grey Connoisseur, this tea is for you! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Heave with bergamot. I am a repeat customer. Wonderful flavor. Great price. great flavor.  my only problem is how much to use.  I have slowly perfected the amount.  You don't need much.  A little goes a long way. Great flavor and great quality I would give this delicious tea 5 stars were it not for a 'natural' flavor added to the tea.  I am not sure, and I do not want to start any conflict with Harney & Sons, inc.  I love their teas, have for decades.  My body systems have become more \"reactive\" to food stuffs that never gave me a problem before, Harney  'E.G.S.' Tea is one of those items.  After 1 cup I started to break out in giant, angry red blotches on my face, neck, and dcolletage.  I thought it was a delayed reaction to something I ate earlier.  So, I tried my second cup, at which point the severe HIVES and angry rashes started faster, were much larger, and also painful, but horrifically itchy.  My delicate facial skin the following day was rough, with the actual tactile feeling of burlap combined with sandpaper, but worse.  At which point I knew this delicious tea was no longer my \"boyfriend' and the break-up would be immediate. Very good i really like ALL of the 'harney & sons' loose teas!  i don't think you can go wrong with any of them! A good Earl Grey; consistent flavor from batch to batch. I frequently mix with a milder Earl Grey to change flavor somewhat. I was very disappointed with this tea. Promoted as a better taste and finer taste - just not so. In fact, the tea tastes a bit like dishwater. The bergamot flavor is not as strong as the plain Earl Grey. I will not be buying this tea again. Just a trumped up fancy name to try and get more $$$ from the consumer I guess.... Best decaf tea. Hard to find loose decaf. Expensive, but worth it. Another great tea for my collection. Arrived on schedule.  A competent tea, but not worth the price. I find that Tetley's decaf tea bags are about as good. A wonderful quality tea. Delicious tea. This is wonderful tea for decaffeinated: far and away the best I've had so far.  But to be clear, it still isn't as good as caffeinated teas are.  Sadly,  there don't seem to be equivalent flavors without caffeine.  Still looking, though, and I'm trying some of the other Harney & Sons decaf teas (not the flavored kind) soon and will report on these.\n",

      "This tea is somewhat  light in flavor, but very pleasant, with more tea flavor and more complex than others decaf's I've tried. Kudos to Harney etc for a superior decaf tea!\n",
      "\n",
      "- Carolyn I'm new to the tea game but already have a love of Earl Grey. I'm trying out as much as I can from as many different vendors as I can. At the time of writing though my experience is limited to only this, Adagio and only a handful of others.. this is clearly the better tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where others may have an overpowering amount of bergamot or focus too much on adding extra to it this seems to have a very well thought out blend that is just a good subtle cup of tea. I keep this tin at work and look forward to my Earl Grey in the mornings and afternoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tin itself is about the size of a mug and is filled to the brim with the tea. While it's not overly decorative it will still make a great gift for any loose leaf tea lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect I'll be buying more from Harney & Sons in the near future. I think maybe I'll try Paris next... Easy to prepare great taste. Convient to store tin.  You don't need a lot of tea to make a mug full Wonderful tea. Normally drink Taylors of Harrogate but thought I would try this based on reviews.  Not really that impressive.  Seems a little weak and definitely very light on the bergamot.  Smooth but not that flavorful. But like coffee, tea is very subjective. Really good; more mellow than other earl grey teas that I've tasted. I bought several Harney & Sons teas when I ordered. This blend was easily my favorite and the tea that disappeared the quickest. This is a delicious Earl Grey tea, full bodied, with the pronounced Bergamot richness inherent in great Earl Grey teas. I find Harney & Sons to be a superior purveyor of teas and I have tried many of their varieties and blends. All have been excellent, with the Earl Grey being my favorite. Very good tea Bergamot flavor is not that intense.  Perhaps the stock is old at Amazon Good tea Average, I was expecting stronger bergamot Outstanding Earl Grey tea. The standard just about that all should go by. The fragrance is unreal. You will not regret this buy. One of my favorite Earl Greys. One of the great Earl Grey teas...as simple as that...I've had one or two others that are as good, none better.\n",
      "when you get it right, not much else to say I like it The tea is rich and smooth, as a black tea with a bergomot flavor that is very subtle, almost non-existent, so if you go to Earl Grey for the bergomot flavor and aroma, this tea may be disappointing in that regard. liked Harney and Sons was a brand that I instantly fell in love with, though their teas can get a little pricey, but that's sort of expected when they sell high-quality loose teas and fine tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure why they added in \"Supreme\" when the taste is delicate and profoundly different from the rest of the Earl Grey teas that you find in the market. Moreover, given than they were only founded in 1983, it shows how they have managed their brand and products in an effective manner, growing to become one of the more reputable tea manufacturers out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other flavours to try: Fine Tea, Bergamot Tea. This is bound to emerge as a signature tea favourite of Harney & Sons Tea Time is now all the time OK There is an odd aftertaste of the black tea used in the Harney & Sons Earl Grey Supreme Tea.  The Bergamot flavor is lovely, but the black tea tastes \"off\" to me.  I know this is subjective to \"my tastes\".  I have tried the Twinings and found the bergamot flavoring to be more lemony than anything else.  The Taylor's of Harrogate Earl Grey has an exquisite bergamot flavor, but the black tea is very weak.  Alas!  I will continue my quest to find the perfect Earl Grey tea that has a good marriage between the black tea and the bergamot flavor.  I am afraid though, that this tea is not it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Upman The teas in the mixture are of good quality but the word \"Supreme\" in the title is a little confusing - it's not related to the bergamot content but to additional \"white\" tea component.\n",
      "Pros:  fine taste (in my opinion - too fine)\n",
      "Cons: the intensity of bergamot taste (the major distinctive component of Earl Grey Tea) is a second to nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I can't recommend it because I personally don't much like it. But maybe people with delicate taste would appreciate it. Harney & Sonds early grey is  acceptable but somewhat flat in flavor.  I'll stick to Harney a& Sons for their English Breakfast tea. Great quality. Has a very strong bergamot scent, which to me is the whole point of drinking earl grey. The tin is also cute. Love earl grey and this is a very good one. Scent is strong and seems like the tea is very fresh. This isn't quite what I had in mind for my Earl Grey, but this is an excellently crafted tea. For those who like delicate teas, this might become your favorite. The tea is a blend including Ceylon Silver Tips, a very expensive tea that is quite light and aromatic. You can see these when you open the tin, which by the way has no foil liner--the tea is just packed right into the can.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bergamot is light and citrusy, not heavy and perfumed. The tea brews up light golden to red depending on how strong you made it; I used 2 full cups (450ml) of water and 3 small tea measures and brewed five minutes (recommended time.) It came out a medium red and a bit weaker than I like. The taste was sweet, no bitterness and a light bergamot scent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: if you like mild, delicate Earl Grey, this will be just what you want. I happen to prefer a bit more robust tea myself, but there is no doubt this is a high quality, very refined tea. I love Earl Grey tea and have been trying different brands to find one that's more available than T*****a. This one comes in a fully packed canister and is very \"Earl Grey.\" I do enjoy it as my breakfast tea but it's a bit strong/bitter for all day sipping. The leaves are not all little pieces of tea dust which is a nice treat from the grocery store brands of loose tea. If you are looking for double bergamot - this is your tea. I try to eat miso somewhat consistently, but it was missing something, and making the stock with this put it spot on! Like most Americans I was a tad hesitant with the overwhelming fishy smell that it has, but it is sooooo worth it. Once the miso paste, green onions and veggies were in... soup was perfect! Even if I'm not making miso or another soup, I add a little of this to my water when boiling noodles. Gives a very good flavor to any dish! :) The results from powdered stock aren't quite as tasty as what you'd get boiling down dried bonito flakes or dried fish themselves *but* this little bottle will save you the 8 or so hours of pervasive fish-stink that comes with making your own from scratch.  I'm not a huge fan of fish, but love Japanese food.  Dashi is in almost ~everything~ and this is a way for me to make it easily in small amounts for single recipes without dry-heaving :3 I'm surprised with this product.  it helps enhance foods with a delicious umami flavor and actually makes a nice broth for ramen. i use it in a mason jar with veggies and noodles for work and when its time to eat i simply add boiling water!! its been a real time saver! Ever find soy sauce even the low sodium soy sauce to be overpowering. Well this is your solution. It has a great soy sauce taste and is sweet not salty. It is great for dipping tempura and sushi. I like to baste my sea scallops with a little bit of this tempura sauce and some oyster sauce, a killer combo. I use it for cooking and dipping. It's tough to get at any of my shopping centers so I was very glad to find it at Amazon delivered right to my feet. thank you. I like the brand, But haven't tried it yet, So I'll let you know what it's like when I do. excellent flavor Good product....love it... I like it. If you cook Japanese food.  This is a must have additives.  I would buy this again next time!  Great for miso soup, Japanese styled fried rice, Cha-Sui, and etc.  Just use it in small amount, do not over use it! I use this (along with MSG) to make Kewpie mayonnaise. If you've ever tried Kewpie you will never go back to anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "We take it up a notch by making it at home with a stick blender. Quick, simple & easy plus no chemicals I used this to make Inarizushi and it was marvelous! So tasty Can't believe I bought this stuff! Good flavour but FULL of so much salt my cardiovascular system must have had a fit the ony time so far I've used it. Am uncertain if I will ever use it again --- BUT if you have no problem with loads of salt -- go for it!  Vendor got product to me quickly, correctly address, well packed, and fairly priced.  If you're into giving it a go -- vendor delivered what he promised, and quickly. Does the job when cooking dinner 5  Stars great product. Vendor shipped it faster than I expected As for the product itself, the sweet sap is taken from sugar cane and is used to make this vinegar. The vinegar has a bit of a tart effect to it, and is often used as a dipping sauce for various foods. It is common in Filipino cuisine to add peppers or spices to make it a spicy and tangy sauce, and is great for your deep fried shrimp and pork! Delicious.  Has a great punch of vinegar Yummy yummy miso soup. Buy the box-of-envelopes version of this product, it's literally half the price per ounce of product. love it Great product. I'm getting into Japanese cooking. I finally decided this is my go to dashi base. I use it primarily for miso soup base, but also use it for ramen and udon noodle bases too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was always going between this and the sachets (Ajinomoto always!) because it is almost half the price as this jar. However, the jar keeps my dashi more fresh. Which makes it last longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do between 1/3 and 1 tsp of dashi per 1 cup of water.  1/3 for my daughters, 1/2 for my wife, and 1 tsp for me. Then I use between 1 and 2 tbsp of miso paste. White for the kids, 1 tbsp white and 1 tbsp red for the wife, and 2 tbsp red for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll boil the dashi, add any veggies, remove from heat, then add the miso.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, this dashi powder is 85-90% as good as Bonito flakes. It's totally worth the almost double the price of the sachets, the only time I'll buy the sachets is when I'm cooking for a group of friends, otherwise I find if I'm not finishing the whole sachet in a week to a week and a half, it starts to lose flavor and starts to taste like my fridge. With this jar, I can keep the jar for months with no issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buy with confidence! This fish stock adds a good flavor to my soup. I wouldn't mind buying it again I'm new to the miso soup scene and was making possibly the biggest rookie mistake ever. I would just whisk a big spoonful of miso into hot water and call it a day. You can image why I thought I just didn't like miso. This changed my whole viewpoint, of course. A spoon of this, bring it to a good heat (but not boil), turn off the gas, add your miso, add your toppings, done. Delicious. Truly makes a world of difference. Made a couple of Japanese dishes with it and liked the flavor. Actually, it would probably be good added to any soup or noodle dish. I am very happy that I was able to purchase this product. The shipping was pushed back so I have to remember buying before running out of this.\n",
      "The shipping part was the only small downside. Instant never meets the grade of fresh-made stock. Another item i re-up on when running low. It makes a great soup base with even just water. Great for miso and authentic I moved and have yet to find a grocery store near my new abode that carries \"world\" items like this in their stocks, so I turned to amazon for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly what I needed, thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as the actual product goes, it's just instant bonito stock. Sorta like bouillon cubes - it's not the absolute best way to go about it but especially in this case, it's very much close enough, especially for the effort involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking to make a miso base for any dish, this will do the trick. nan I was using plain white vinegar for my adobo but finally bought this.  The flavor is incredible and a huge difference in Filipino food. I use this because it has a strong vinegar taste Great product for Asian dishes!! Great price, fast service. Great stuff! Gives dishes that undeniably Japanese flavor. Excellent Product. This was great.  I made miso soup with it and it turned out wonderful just like at the sushi bar.  I simply added a couple of teaspoons to a pot of hot water and added my tofu and miso.  I will say however that I wish there were clearer directions on the water to stock ratio.  I just did it by taste and that worked out well enough.  Quality was great,  I was worried it would be too fishy tasting/smelling but it was very subtle and mild.  Put it in the fridge after opening. . A tiny bit goes a long way and the flavor is great. I absolutely love this product and keep it on hand all the time.  Highly recommend!  So tasty and easy to grab when I need a hot cup of soup! This is so simple to use and has made making miso soup so easy!  It tastes great, not too fishy, in my opinion, but everyone's tastes are different, just use less or more to taste. Making Ikura never been more interesting. A must for home prep of Japanese soups.  Nice value. This is instant fish broth.  It has earned a permanent place in my kitchen. A must have for Japanese cuisine Very Good This stuff is AMAZING! I used to make my own dashi with the bonito flakes and the konbu and the boiling and the straining. x.x Ugh! It was a headache. With this, you just measure it out, throw it in the water, add your miso paste, and BAM! Perfect miso soup. It is a rather small container, but after going through an entire container of awase miso paste, I still have over half of this container left. One thing to keep in mind though, is that a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon will not fit in the mouth of this thing. I have been using 3 teaspoons instead so that I don't have to pour it into my tablespoon and risk losing some of this deliciousness. Exactly what I was needing to make homemade miso soup.  After I bought this the first time, I ordered a few more before I was even half way through with this stock. I am so excited to make my own miso soup now! Very good!  Not too salty.  Nice bonito flavor, but not too fishy.  Savory and delicious! great  to perk up  sauces Great for desserts I bought this for a special recipe that required the Chinese Five Spices in Pumpkin Pie.  I was surprised at how much difference the addition of Annise spice made in the taste.  I like it! I use this a lot. Great stuff.. all seems well, used in a few soups so far... but now that i think about it, my head feels light and my feet are tingly  )) I was put off by the MSG. good I add a little of this to my miso soup for a deeper flavor. Great quality product. This made a simple and great tasting Miso Soup.  I would recommend it without hesitation. YUM! This is the perfect addition to miso soup. Highly recommended! It's very strong in this form and the first time I made miso (which includes Dashi) the receipt said 2 tablespoons and it tasted like fish soup.  ugh.  Anyway, it's strong so start small and taste test through the whole thing. Whoops. I *didn't* read the label, and bought this product...\n",

I can smell every spice!  Can not WAIT to wok with this!  Nice glass jar, packaged great, tight and safety lid... YUM WHAT a great addition to our every day or asian spice mixes!  I think just sprinkled on white rice would be fabulous.  A Must for your spice cabinet! Arrived on tim . Item was as described easy to make loved the flavor. Great to have in the house to make recipes. Very flavorful. Authentic fish soup stock with great taste. Easy to use and dissolves nicely. I use this as a base for miso soup.  This is very flavorful.  I may have to buy more since my son has been requesting miso soup on a weekly basis. Really delicious.  It is mildly spiced, but has tons of flavor.  Goes great in so many dishes.  You really can cook some fantastic Asian food at home with the right ingredients, and this is one of those ingredients.  I'm almost certain that my favorite Thai restaurant uses this exact product.\n",

      "Lee Kum Kee's Oyster Sauce is also excellent and I'm anxious to try their other products. It is what it says it is. Wonderful flavor enhancer for veggies. Do I need to write anymore? It smells s good. Nice flavoring for dishes. Give it a try, not just for Oriental food. Despite the bottle size, there isn't much content. But for the price, it's a good way to try working with dashi. Like the other reviewers, I agree that it has a very strong fishy smell. But once its in water, the smell is pleasant and the flavor is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of salt, so I tend to use prepared stock items very sparingly, which is the perfect plan for this item as well. when you don't have the time to prepare kombu and bonito flakes, like for a quick bowl of miso breakfast soup, Hon-Dashi really takes just a few minutes to fix. throw in some of last nights noodles, a raw egg, and you are ready for work. It's not quite as good as the real thing, but it sure helps for the quick fix. Great seasoning I use it for sea food and soups. high sodium content so a little goes a long way. The picture give the impression that the jar is larger than it actually is so keep in mind this is actually only 2ozs Perfect for miso soup. The pre-packaged miso soup is way to salty for me. I can make a moderately seasoned soup using miso paste,  kombu and wakame, seasoned with the Hon-Dashi. Great Product  Fast Shipping A+++ great shipper I love the flavor and use it not only when I make Chinese food, but in other items. this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby.

BTW \"star anise\" or \"aniseed\" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish. I really don't have enough words to fill this spot so lets just say I love Chinese cooking and this is okay. I've never used Chinese Five Spices before, but we had a holiday goose and I wanted to try it in combination with citrus to flavor the bird. It was a real winner and I loved the spice combo. In fact, I like it so much that I'm finding other recipes just to use more of it.\n",

      "If you've got a recipe that calls for it, I highly recommend giving this one a shot. Ah, that hits the spot. Needed this for my Chinese dishes, and I don't regret it. It's the same as the stuff I'd buy in China. This is an excellent version of five-spice powder, which does not seem to follow any standard formula.  I have several different ones on hand, and this is my favorite.  Good flavor. Excellent price and the price is very reasonable.

      "Just because food is made by chinese doesn't mean it's good chinese food. I used to find Five Spice in the supermarket when we lived in PHX. But here in NC it is hard to find so I happy that I can order this online. I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful. It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well. I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard. This was ok - a bit strong on the licorice, so it is not the best that I have had. I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it! It is good. I live in the Bahamas and a friend of mine had it and I loved what they cooked with it and I couldn't buy it here so I am glad I was able to find it online. I've used this in marinades and stir-fries. The most surprising but best use was in a rub/glaze I made for baked chicken drumsticks. Wow! It brought the exact right amount of heat and flavor to the party, balanced nicely with the brown sugar and other spices I used. Have had a couple of people ask me for that recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat is a mixed bag in my household - I love it, bring it on. But not so much for others. This product is a good middle ground. Not too spicy, but still full of flavor. This is now my new favorite \"go to\" for marinating chicken, meat, ribs and so on.  We love heat in this family and this product certainly fits the bill.  Will definitely be ordering again. Chinese black vinegar has very distinctive flavors that come from the fermentation of rice and other whole grains like barley.  This has a nice, slightly smoky, slightly sweet, almost plum-like, piquant flavoring that makes it a great complementary component for a variety of dishes.  This is the sweeter variety of black vinegar that is better suited for dipping (steamed buns, steamed dim sum dishes), rather than the cooking variety (which trends towards being more astringent, with stronger vinegar flavor), albeit it is completely suitable to cook with.\n",

      "A lot of people focus on the hard spices and thicker sauces when cooking, but overlook the importance and versatility of vinegars.  This is a must have for authentic Chinese cuisine. milder than most vinegars, but with its own very special taste to add to Ume Plum vinegar, and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor! It's vinegar I lived in China for years and the black vinegar was rich, robust with a great taste.\n",
      "This product is a ghost of what it should be.\n",
      "Still trying to find the real Black Vinegar. It is not traditional Chinese vinegar, tastes sort of funny Black vinegar has become my favorite condiment. I love it cooking and in homemade salad dressings. It is pretty versatile. Very pleased. We have been waiting for this item. To purchase it at a price, we thought was reasonable. This is why we jumped on it.\n",

      "November I like black vinegar, I like the way it taste. and this is good,  michael A big bottle of yum I am anxious to give this a try in my oriental cooking. i use this in my cooking...excellent. Item as described This is essential for a yummy, strong tasting Hot and Sour Soup.  Great, great product.  Try it. Mild and delicious, I like this just about as well as white rice vinegar. It's a good choice when you need a gentle souring agent. not sour enough for me A different taste from what I'm familiar with. Enhances a lot of different foods. Makes vegetables stand out and gives new life to bland dishes. I couldn't find black vinegar anywhere... not in specialty stores, or chinese markets or anywhere. I had all but given up before finding this. Good size bottle. Vinegar is well aged, so it's slightly sweet and slightly acidic but not overly bitter or powerful. Compare to a very mild balsamic. I use this in my Hot N Sour soup and also when frying rice or noodles for Asian dishes. I read about this stuff and had to try it....  The complex flavor should add that \"something special\" to a dish....  I have an assortment of \"flavor\" in a bottle in the pantry...  Still haven't tried it in a complete dish....  A drop or 5 in a dish should perk it up nicely...  Sort of an Umami \"what a unique flavor profile\" this food has..... type thing...  When I use it in a complete dish, I will report back...  still experimenting...  for a couple bucks, what the hey.... add it to your arsenal of \"hidden secrets\"...... Once I had the time to learn to cook my favorite Chinese restaurant dishes from scratch, it didn't take long for me to find the best Chinese cook books and the best ingredients. Some of my family's favorite Chinese restaurant dishes are Potstickers, Broiled Wings, Egg Foo Yung, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Fried Rice and any chicken dishes. I found all these in my favorite old cook book from 1983- Better Homes And Gardens Cooking Chinese.  To say the recipes are exactly like our favorite Chinese restaurant dishes would be an understatement. These recipes are THE BEST and even better than the restaurant's dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second favorite cook book is also an older book- from 1981-Betty Crocker's Chinese Cookbook by Leeann Chin. There are no Potsticker recipes, but so many delicious chicken ones are in here. The Potstickers are a very time consuming labor of love, so I learned to put a day aside to make them. Once you make the delicious dough, you seal the cooked pork or beef filling inside, not cooking the Potsticker yet, then I wrap up 6 at a time in saran wrap. I then double wrap them and seal them in a freezer bag. I keep them in the freezer until I need them. Because they take so long to prepare, I make a double batch- having dozens to freeze- they stay perfect for a few months in the freezer. When I want to make them- I just take them from the freezer to the refrigerator, and leave them in the refrigerator all day thawing (at least 5 hours). They are then ready to easily cook- I just brown the bottoms for a minute with a tiny bit of oil, then add water, cover and 10-12 minutes later, they are ready to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sauces really make the Potstickers and bring the WOW flavor to them. Most recipes say to use Rice Vinegar and Soy Sauce together, but I found using the Black Vinegar with Soy Sauce is a thousand times more delicious! We then found we love to use this sauce on everything- over rice, chicken, ribs, Potstickers- it is too delicious for words. Black Vinegar is simply rice vinegar with caramel and a couple more ingredients, and it has a sweeter, smoky flavor that is out of this world! For the Best Dipping Sauce ever, you simply use equal parts Black Vinegar and Soy Sauce. We use the Light Soy Sauce, as we have to watch the sodium, and after trying a few diffferent brands of Black Vinegar, we found Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is so delicious! After stirring the equal parts Light Soy Sauce and Black Vinegar together, you just add thinly sliced green onions in- and that's it! The BEST Dipping Sauce ever! Rice Vinegar is more sour in taste and not as delicious, and in comparison the smoky sweetness of the Chinese Black Vinegar can't be beat!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the delicious Koon Chun Black Vinegar is very difficult to find in my area. There are very few Asian Stores and the two that we have do not carry this Koon Chun brand. When I found Amazon carries the Koon Chun Black Vinegar, I was thrilled. The price is on the high side, but worth every penny, as there is just no flavor that comes close to Black Vinegar.  When it comes to the most delicious dipping sauces that really bring the WOW factor to all our favorite Chinese dishes- Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is it! Our favorite Potstickers never tasted this good from any Chinese restaurant! My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location.  I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock, but I don't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store, plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me.  I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product, but there it is.\n",

      "I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME.  It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores, but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment.  The flavor is subtle and isn't overbearing even if you load it on to increase the heat.  Very versatile and very good. I got this specifically to make dan dan noodles, and it was perfect! the chunky bits of chili are so good I use this when I make chinese stir frys too. its really spicy but not omg my mouth..its a smoother spicy if that makes any sense lol I like it, but a little too salty for me Great for use in noodle dishes this chili oil has a rich savory and spicy flavor with just the right amount of heat. I use it with roasted potatoes to and they always come out nicely. I was very disappointed with this product. I didn't care that it was way overpriced; I was dying to have some good chili oil in my refridgerator. This wasn't it. It just doesn't taste that good. Makes any asian side dishes delicious, a must have. I took a star only because it's not spicy at all. Its all about the aroma and flavor it gives, very distinct. To much garlic Love it!!! We put it on everything. What a flavor!!! Great product as always. Love, love, love this stuff. The perfect touch to an avocado toast breakfast and so many other dishes. Great addition to many Asian foods.  Quite spicy. not what I expected, my mistake and,don't even know what it was for as its in Chinese, and it leaked every where. second bottle of hot stuff that leaked this week Great taste for those who like the spice in Chinese recipes.  I was unable to find this product in my local grocery stores. The product was in great shape, appears fresh and is delicious for my miso soup. Will have no hesitation purchasing this brand again. Took a couple of tries to get a feel for preparing this seaweed. But after you get a salad that tastes good, you'll never want to be without this product\n",
      "Excellent flavor.\n",
      "Excellent pricing (compared to local stores) As you may have read, seaweed is a good source of nutrients, and has benefits for your skin and hair. Wakame is a kind of kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you use wakame a lot, this bag will fit your bill. I've been using this brand for years because it's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more. Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I've had in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice. You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo, or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating, otherwise it'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy.\n",

      "Product of Korea. Best stuff out there! Not too spicy and hot but it is at the same time! Not unbearable. good but pricey! Hot stuff! Great for cooking. Watch out for the bottom of the jar, though. It collects any drips and will stain easily. My mom buys this jar all the time for her cooking. I use it for sauce for vegetable, fish, meat and dumplings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It work like a paste and spread too. You can cook with it because it has a lot of oil. Let the meat soak up all that spicy-ness.\n",
      "I mix it with soy sauce and vinegar for a dumpling sauce and it's so good. Great for seafood too.\n",
      "It's not super duper spicy but definitely get you gasping for air. I am a huge seaweed fan and this is no exception. I soak it in purified water, drain it and eat it like noodles with a little bit of sesame seeds and green onion. Yum! I'm raw vegan so this is perfect in my repertoire. Just wish it came with more bc I can go through this fast! first time buyer. I like it. Much better value for price than the wakame at my nearby health foods store. One bag will last you a really long time. Highly recommended. We use several different kinds of Wakame in this house and this particular one is just perfect for making miso soup. Lovely, mild flavor. The seaweed was dried perfectly and well packed. The size of the individual pieces is nice for those who like a good bit of wakame in their miso. Two ounces may not seem like a lot, but believe me, this is a large quantity. I have lived in different places and eaten at many chinese restaurants and I have also had decent store bought chinese mustard, but I have no idea what this crap is.  It isn't even good mustard.  It is just horrible.  There is also nothing hot about it.  I am also not a fan of the Dynasty duck sauce, so I will be avoiding all of their products from now on. I grew up in Philly and NY and traveled extensively. Dined in so many excellent Chinese restaurants in every major U.S.city. I love really Hot Chinese mustard and ordered this product. It is awful. The worst! Thick paste NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING MILDLY HOT. Gulden's brown mustard is better. Save your money. THIS IS REALLY AWFUL. You will throw it out along with your money! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. The only thing authentic about this product is the label. Not quite as hot as I expected but still good. Closest thing I've found to what I used to use at a noodle bar in Hong Kong - nothing else seems to come close - perfect addition to almost anything - I often use it as an addition to ramen or lentil stew - I always have a bottle or two extra in the house so that I never run out. :-) This is the old stuff, which (at least in California) is extremely hard to find: dried chili in vegetable oil.  I recall that you used to find a jar of this hot classic on every table of every Chinese-American restaurant, but for some unknown reason they seem to have switched to chili pastes (too sharp, vinegary, fruity for my liking).  Very glad I can get the old burn back -- I might just start carrying this jar whenever I go out for Asian cuisine, since it's too good to just use on leftovers. I use this to make a spicy cucumber salad and it is full of flavor and I love using it! Excellent quality. Would buy again GOOD Excellent, I make a salad out of with just Sesame oil and Tsuyu noodle sauce base. Tastes great. I've been using this particular wakame for simple seaweed salad for a while, after using mixed dried seaweeds for about a year.  The mixes are a little more exciting, but also much more expensive.  These aren't as uniformly small - some are flat sheets after being rehydrated, but just cut them when dry and you can make smaller pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "I make a basic and easy seaweed salad for snacking - about 1 serving of this seaweed (about 10 grams; there are 6 servings in the package), soy sauce, ginger powder, julienned cucumber and carrots or radish, a dash of fish sauce, and some crushed red pepper (or japanese pepper flakes if you can find them).  Makes a great snack or first course for dinner. I use this with the dried anchovies for miso soup. better that the restaurants Wonderful But it will bite!  Yum! Its OK for Chinese mustard, but not very hot. The hot Chinese mustard does not have vinegar, etc added. Bought this from Caputos and regret it.  The mustard has no spice at all to it and mostly just tastes a bit vinegary.  Avoid this one like the plague. Spicy, smoky, with a bite.  Not your usual Asian hot sauce.  Made with fermented beans, is a special treat from Hong Kong. I did not dig the taste. I ended up buying chilli oil freshly prepared by a Chinese restaurant and it was absolutely fabulous and much cheaper. Check with your local chinese restaurant. They might sell you some in a container. I think this is a bit hotter than the S&B Chili Oil with Crunchy Garlic and the nearly identical Momoya product.  This one seems heavier on the heat than the salt, while the others are heavier on the salt than the heat.  They're all good, just different heat/salt ratios.  One advantage to this brand is that the container is much larger than the S&B and Momoya jars I've seen, so it lasts longer.  As with the others, give this a good stir before you use it. We have a favorite recipe that calls for chili oil. I couldn't find it in our local grocery and so was glad to find it on Amazon. It is the only chili oil I have tried. I found it to be very authentic tasting. Unless I venture to try another one and find it to be better, I am comfortable leaving a 5 star review. I am a fan of spicy hot Asian food and this is the best bottled chili oil I have tried ... so good I will no longer bother trying to duplicate my favorite Asian restaurant chili oil myself I love this stuff! It is great in dipping sauces. I also like this in my chicken soup broth or pretty much any soup. I wouldn't think of eating Ramen noodles normally but with some of this stuff, I will eat it and like it. I think it is better than Schriacha sauce, you just have to be careful and use a small amount till you know how strong it is and then you will be adding  it to everything. I do a quick dipping sauce with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and this oil. Great for dumplings! This is a staple that everyone should have in kitchen. Although many folks cook with this oil I use it as a condiment. I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick. I wish I could elaborate on how it works for sir frying, but I do not use it that way. I can say that it is an excellent condiment. I love hot sauces and love experimenting with various ones. Lately I have been using a lot of products from this brand and this one is among my favorites.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I love it is the flavor and the piquant character balance one another. Of course the piquant factor dominates the flavor profile (although this is not super spicy to my palate). The garlic is easily detected, but the surprise is the sweet aspect of the flavor profile, which seems to dominate more than the salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the piquant quality - this does have a slight bite and some spiciness, but if you can tolerate a serrano pepper you will not have any problems. For me I prefer a little more spiciness so I will often add some finely chopped bird's eye chilis to the sauce. Of course spiciness is both subjective and relative. If a jalapeno is too hot for you may want to avoid this. On the other hand, if a habanero is not enough, you will have to kick it up with additional peppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me it's all about flavor and this one has it. It not only works with stir fry dishes, but also in American dishes like grilled beans and as the base for stews and soups. A dab of this when making scampi will add a lot to that dish as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutritionally a teaspoon contains only 10 calories and a single gram of carbs. However, it also contains 410mg of sodium, so if you have restrictions note that and use this sparingly. In fact, use it as a condiment in lieu of salt on some dishes for a real treat.\n",

      "If you love spicy sauces and want to fuse Chinese flavors into your tried and true menus, or to make authentic Chinese dishes this is a great shortcut. It's earned a spot in my pantry. My aunt is from Asia area, she loves it. Obliviously it contains too salt, and in my opinion, it is not healthy at all I purchased this wasabi powder at our local Shaw's (same as Albertson's) for $2.99.  It is a very practical way to buy wasabi because you can make your own wasabi for sushi simply by adding water and stirring it together in a small bowl or you can add this to mayonnaise, mustard, oil and vinegar or do whatever you please with it.  This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative.  How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak?\n",
      "Have fun with this practical grocery item that only takes up a small amount of space in your cupboard!  Or pack it in your bag when you head off for the weekend! \"Hime\" is \"Princess Brand\" and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes.\n",
      "One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz.\n",
      "I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.) Yum hbjb This is good powdered wasabi. Let it sit for a half hour after you mix it with water in order to build up heat. It loses its spiciness rather rapidly once you open it compared to other dried spices. I took a star off for that because they don't put it on the label. They must can it under inert gas or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly what Japanese people eat. Don't listen to people complaining that it is not real wasabi. You don't want real caterpillar in your caterpillar roll or real dog in your hot dog. You don't want real wasabi, either, because it doesn't taste very good. Real wasabi is just a restaurant gimmick to separate rubes from their money. Love it! Just add water and I am happy! Tastes great! Easy to make and so much more flavorable than the tube-kind. Good price, fast delivery Wasabi flavor but no wasabi heat. I think I could eat a spoonful of this and remain unphased. I'm used to restaurant wasabi where the vapor rushes up and out your sinuses, like a ball of fire and the poof - it's gone. I was looking for something with heat to it so this was disappointing. But - it was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition (something I'm coming to appreciate more and more these days). I love horseradish and the probably flammable mustard you get in Chinese restaurants.  This is not less flammable.  We approach it with great care and consume it with vast love. very small container, had i known it would be this small i would have ordered another couple of tins. but all in all, this is excellent product!! I've tried this brand (Hime) several times, and it always came up a little \"short\" on flavor.  The last time I tried it, I purchased it from Kroger's Food Store (sorry, Amazon).  I ended up taking it back and getting my money back.  I've tried S&B powder \"Wasabi\" powder, and it convinced me to start purchasing that brand.  Especially when a 1 Kilo bag of powder is less than $15 bucks!  It's the best imitation Wasabi powder I've ever had.  To make it last (I probably have several years supply of it), I vacuum-packed 1/4 pound bags in the Food Savor bags, and then stuck them in my freezer.  The bags are \"double-sealed\", as there is a vacuum bag inside of another vacuum sealed bag.  Double protection, I hope.\n",
      "  If you like your \"Wasabi\" paste a little on the light side, I recommend the Hime brand, but if you want it \"kicking good\" like the real Sushi restaurants serve, go with S&B Brand.  Thanks for reading this. I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was. At $7.60, I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can. As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $3, but never used it fast enough so it would get old. I figured a powder would be better, so I can mix it as I needed it. When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can, I started looking for the hidden cameras ...  thought this HAD to be a joke. Nope .. and it's NOT returnable either. SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON. Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder. This powder is what any sushi or Ahi Tuna lover needs to compliment the fish.  I mix the powder with hot chili oil and soy sauce for a marinade when making poke or Ahi Tuna ceviche. I was looking to try genuine wasabi, and I bought this product thinking \"Japanese horseradish\" was the real thing.  It is not... apparently it's just regular European horseradish grown in Japan.  The ingredient list contains horseradish, mustard, corn flour and corn starch, and a bunch of artificial colors.  In that regard, needless to say, I was disappointed, although for roughly $8 I can't have too much buyer's remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste-wise, however, the product is fine, and is exactly like the fake wasabi paste everyone is used to from most sushi restaurants.  I take 1/4 teaspoon of the powder in a bowl, and add water drop-wise while rolling it with my fingertip until I get the right consistency.  I'll continue to use the rest this product (it'll probably last me a year) because it has a nice pungent horseradish taste that indeed complements my take-home sushi well.  But when this product runs out, or maybe even before, I'll look more carefully for a real 100% wasabi product to see what the real deal tastes like.  It seems like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sushi-Sonic-100-Real-Powdered-Wasabi-1-5-Ounce-Jars-Pack-of-3/dp/B001EPQOM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sushi Sonic 100% Real Powdered Wasabi, 1.5-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a>&nbsp;might fit the bill, so that one I might try next. I like HOT spices - so this is so I have - whan I want / need it - for that \"right taste\" ! unsure if I just got a bad batch or what...the flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabi...followed the directions exactly, but just didn't get the results I was hoping for I wish this had a lot more kick in it.  Flavor is ok.  Still trying to figure out what I should use it on. I cannot understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods. I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it (which is not a good combo). I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry. fermented shrimpy goodness. I use this for making my homemade kimchi. It works great! My kimchi tastes perfect. This is the only shrimp sauce that I can use since I am on a strict elimination diet because I am breastfeeding my son.  I cook with this and he wouldn't break out.  It makes my so upas and salads more flavorful since I don't have many choices of ingredients to cook with on my diet. I'd never purchased any Lee Kum Kee products before, but I saw that this shrimp sauce had only 2 ingredients (whole shrimp & salt) so I checked out their website. Most shrimp paste is made by mixing fresh shrimp with salt, pulverizing the combination, then letting it  sit outside to dry in open tanks. (Which can be kinda dicey in places like China, where there's rampant air pollution.) This is what the  company's US website said: **\"Lee Kum Kee has improved the traditional processing techniques by selecting the best silver shrimp and drying them in a pollution-free greenhouse instead of constantly exposing them to outdoor conditions. This ensures our products are produced in hygenic conditions and guarantees food safety. The shrimp are fermented and dried without adding any preservatives, MSG or artificial coloring so they retain their natural taste.\"**  That sold me on it. (Amazon also had it for less than than the manufacturer's website.) Unlike every other shrimp paste I've tried, Lee Kum Kee isn't a hard, caked powder. I opened the jar to find a thick pudding consistency, with all the robust shrimp flavor you get from the usual versions of shrimp paste. Because it's wet, you definitely need to refrigerate it once opened. (Bacteria love a wet environment.) But I'm thrilled that I no longer have to use a hammer to break off pieces from a block of shrimp paste. Now, I can spoon out a precise measurement that I don't have to dissolve in boiling water before I can cook with it. A tiny bit goes a looooong way. Seriously. I don't know if it's me or if I got an old jar but this is absolutely putrid!!!  I hate it!!  I bought it to make my kimchi & never used the paste before so I thought I'd try it, oh my god I almost threw up from the smell! This stuff is disgusting , I threw it away , but I gave it 5 stars , because it's probably good to people who like this stuff , it was well packed and arrived early , but it tasted like something that was scraped out of Hulk Hogans underwear , after doing squats in the gym for six hours , well , that and a slight hint of CRAP !!  Niether my cats or my dogs would eat this !  But try it , maybe YOU will like it ! Thought it was like belacan but not. More fishy. These are a little larger than pastina.  We use it in chicken soup and sometimes swirl in an egg or two for a heartier meal.  You can also just have it with butter; yum.  I'm never without this pasta. I LOVE these, I've used them for YEARS. I do wish they were less expensive. Always my all-time pasta!!! Makes a great fruit salad.... So hard to find this any more.  Great to have on hand. I luv this kind of pasta, for making 'pastine in brood' , with chicken broth.  However, I was very disappointed with lack of tracking capability & time-line for delivery of this order! Nice preserves, good quality from an excellent company.  Good old fashioned flavor.  Made with real sugar, not that corn syrup stuff. I was looking for chutneys and this caught my eye.  It is very good with a great morello cherry flavor.  It is super sweet though and for that matter I see using this only as a jam or in a dessert. I cannot buy these in my local grocery store.  I have bought other brands which i prefer, but these are an acceptable product all the same. Recently, while dining out at a fine local Italian restaurant, I had the Pappardelle Bolognese. It was delicious. The sauce was terrific, but I had never had pappardalle before, and this pasta interacted with the sauce to wonderful effect. I decided that I had to purchase some pappardelle and serve it with my own meat sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was happy to discover that the combination worked well together for me. I really enjoyed the taste of a nice pappardelle. And this brand tasted quite good. The pasta had a nice smooth taste and texture to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I am a satisfied customer. Have tried the store found brands and the noodles have not held up to my recipes. These held up and tasted very good.  I've found a new and true pappardelle egg noodle. Thank you! Great wide egg noodle.  They hold up against the thicker sauces.  I only use De Cecco pasta!  I have used this pasta for over 30 years and will only use this brand.  No matter what I will always find De Cecco somewhere.  I always keep at least a one year supply, as there tends to be times where it is hard to find and I don't have a backup pasta to go to! These are just the best - cannot find this variety of pasta anywhere nearby and am so glad to find them available here.  Try them with fresh asparagus and a lemon sauce - you will not be disappointed. Noodles are okay but too expensive will not purchase again These are very good. I paid $3 for them at the time. it was ok .. not a fan though ... Yummy!  A great al dente texture and a rich flavor make for a very satisfying pasta.  They taste good with sauce or with just a little browned butter and some fresh grated parmesan.  In order to get the full, eggy richness from the noodle, make sure you salt the cooking water.  They didn't need to cook as long as most dried pasta, so check them after 5 or 6 minutes. I liked it. Cooked perfectly. My ex had asked for a certain casserole I used to make, so i used it in that. Next time I am keeping it all for myself. The reason for not being 5 stars is that there was a lot of packaging and not as much pasta as I would have liked for the price. Love the pasta. Unfortunately, the nest are very delicate. 2 out of the four nest were in pieces. So pasta was very small pieces. Good product but not so much for shipping. Probably better to buy in a supermarket where you can check the product first. Love the texture.  A bit pricy but good for special event meals. thought they were egg.  going to give them to girlfriend Giving a 5 for taste but a 3 for packaging.  These noodles are delicious. They have a wonderful texture and taste.  But they are packaged with a thin plastic top and half the noodles were in bits by the time they got to us.  I would buy again, just not from amazon. Luxuriously good.  Worth the price - this is great pasta. Just exactly what I was looking for - a wide noodle that is a mouthful!  Just like my gramma used to make. Excellent pasta.  Perfect fit for my homemade Bolognese sauce.  Nice texture and taste.  Stands up beautifully to heavy sauces.  Also used with Alfredo sauce with fresh peas and asparagus.  Wonderful!  Quality I have come to expect from DeCecco.  I use their pastas almost exclusively.  Highly recommend. I love De Cecco pasta products.  Their pasta nests, like these, are the closest you can get to fresh made pasta.  Unfortunately, these are about 4x more expensive on Amazon vs my local store.  In short: highly recommended product, however, they are overpriced on Amazon. Richly and subtly flavorful, this dark brown rice vinegar tastes slightly less acidic than apple cider vinegar but is not nearly so sweet as balsamic and brings a delicate, interesting flavor to salads and cooking.  Everyone to whom I have served it in salad dressing has raved about it. Much expensive than the Chinese Superamrket. I'm fortunate enough to live in a city with Chinatown, another area with Asian markets(Thai & Vietnamese), Korean markets and Japanese markets. In my search for the genuine thing, I hit about 10 shops and finally found the genuine item in Super H supermarket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strangely, the 4 Chinese grocers in Chinatown I normally visit did not have the real Gold Plum brand. I have many bottles that looked very similar but the real brand actually says Gold Plum.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bottle is very similar and very deceptive, but pass on it. It's not worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price for the real thing? About $2.75! Since I can't read Chinese characters, I can't tell if this is \"Gold Plum\".  The labels I can read say \"CTF Brand\" with a picture of three stag's heads, if that helps.  The bottle I received is different from the image portrayed on the webpage so the product may not be the Gold Plum brand.  That said, the ingredients are stated as \"water, glutinous rice, salt\", with \"no additives\" which from another review, is what Chinkiang Vinegar is supposed to be...nothing fancy.  It passes my taste test anyway.  The vinegar I received is full-bodied and complex.  As some of the Asian cookbooks state, the taste is somewhat like Balsamic vinegar, which is a substitute for Chinkiang vinegar in many recipes, but I would add that \"somewhat like\" only applies to the cheap Balsamic vinegar sold in most grocery stores.  If you have ever had the truly wonderful, aged Aceto Balsamico di Modena, that costs as much or more than an 18 y/o bottle of single malt scotch (several varieties of which are sold on Amazon, by the way), there is really no comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the other reviews stated that the bottle came in an \"unsanitary condition\", meaning that the bottle had leaked.  I would have to agree with that.  The bottle cap is apparently not air tight, allowing it to leak during shipping.  The bottle I received had leaked into the plastic bags inside the cardboard box, and the entire outside of the bottle was saturated, as were several of the plastic bags the bottle had been placed in.  The bottle appears to have only leaked a couple of fluid ounces, but this is pungent stuff, requiring that the shipping box and interior packaging be immediately banished to the outside trash and the bottle rinsed off and towel dried...I just hope that this vinegar is also good for the skin and hands!  :) I live in an area where finding any kind of genuine ingredients for preparing ethnic dishes is nearly impossible.  I buy most of them here on Amazon.  The Chinkiang Vinegar is awesome.  Try some... you will love it. Your name doesn't have to be David to find a big old grin on your face at the sight of the bright red tin that says \"David's Cookies\"! Two delicous pounds of homemade-good cookies. Just enough for one big kid and a gallon of milk. Indulge. Smile. Meet ya at the playground : ) good These cookies are delicious! I will buy them again. God!!!! These are so damn good and FRESH so far my favorite is the Oatmeal raisin cookies and the Chocolate chip cookies they're so good Im definitely ordering more. Gave ad a gift. They were fresh and good. Really good I love it over my pancakes and my capuccinos This stuff is magic and zeo cals! Why can't more products be splenda-based and ZERO calorie yet taste SO good!  If you love the taste of cinnamon and sugar, you will LOVE this product.  I have ordered several times and put it on my oatmeal, squash, popcorn, toast, waffles, etc.  The best part is that it is zero calories but tastes like real cinnamon sugar.  The health benefits of cinnamon have been known and this product contains real cinnamon as well.  Give it a try!! I always buy several at a time.  It makes the best cinnamon toast, or you can sprinkle it on natural applesauce (the kind without sugar) Positively divine!!!!  Fresh!!!! Yummy for the tummy!!! These were sent to a business as a thank you.  They loved them. Love brie was good thank u. It has a great flavor, but not enough refrigeration in transit and it had an extremely unpleasant smell when it arrived.  I have eaten brie cheese for years but the quantity was too much to keep properly. This is an excellent cheese from igourmet.com. The cheese we received was very fresh,and was by far the best french brie ,we had ever tasted...This cheese makes an excellent holiday gift,and is highly recommended ...\"Enjoy\" GREAT = 10 Stars Yum! Great gift. Delivered on time. The cookies came on time and packaged nicely. Never mind the fact that the cookies were fresh and delicious. Cookies were very fresh and shipped very quickly. I have purchased these on three different occasions for gifts and they loved them. They stated they were very good cookies and the containers are nice. The Person seemed to enjoy them they ate them in 2 days loli would have like to try one for myself i guess i will buy again. Cookies arrived in record time and were delicious and fresh.  Everyone in the office enjoyed them as did I.  I'll be back to purchase more when I'm able to afford them.  They are a little pricey but worth the cost!!!!!  Thank you... The oatmeal raisin cookies are the best I have ever eaten. I also sent an order to my mother and she agreed! Thank you for such a wonderful delicious, fresh product. As ALWAYS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT!! David's products are ALWAYS Fresh & Stay fresh longer than most other cookies. These cookies rule! Fresh as can be and very tasty! I mailed them to relatives at Christmas with other gifts and guess what they all said? Those cookies were the best! Didn't last one day! Mushy! :( Great flavor. Use on a variety of foods. Very good product. What says I love you like a jar of kraut on valentines day?  Great on kielbasa dogs with peppers and mustard. hit this one out off the park. We don't need no stinking chocolate! Delicious! And so good for me. It has live probiotics for a healthy stomach which I need since I have celiac disease. I eat it right out of the jar. Wonderful! i think pasurized  kills probiotics I ordered this as a gift for our resort office staff and they were thrilled!  So thank you for helping me make their holiday season a bit more delicious! The cookies were moist and had a lot of raisins. Very good. No probiotics. It is a fermented product but it's also pasturized so there's no active bacteria and thus not probiotic. I heard this from the Kuhne office after emailing through their web page about it. GOOD QUAILTY AND DELICIOUS, IT IS TRULY HEALTH FOOD IN A JAR. I ADD A SLICED ONION AND SOME CHICKEN STOCK AND LET IT SIMMER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND ENJOY THIS SAUERKRAUT WITH ALL OF MY MEALS. This is a good kraut with a nice flavor to it. This barrel sauerkraut is absolutely delicious! It is rather expensive, but I savored every bite of it. I ate it right out of the jar. Yum. Found cookies to be so so and ok. Certainly far from the best. Dont agree with rave reviews. Large homemade style with fresh tasting cookie dough and large chocolate chunks throughout the cookies. Taste delicious. I love sauerkraut and have made my own but was just being lazy.  This is wonderful sauerkraut OK, but not really what I was looking for.  Thanks This is really a very good sauerkraut.  It does not taste bitter or strong.  I like it. this is just like I remember as a child in Germany.  The only drawback that I saw was not having any caraway seeds.  Just the right amount of sour and spice. took to share with my coworkers.  they were happy i didn't get even one.  bummed out. Yes these were wonderful. I sat and ate them by myself while watching a white Christmas, wishing we had snow.. 29  and no snow! The cookies made it better. White chocolate macadamia cherry.  Lots in the tin, layers of them. Worth every penny. This is one of the best store-bought saurkrauts that you can buy.  I actually prefer this same company's red cabbage, but only by a narrow margain.  This regular saurkraut is nicely sour, but not bitter.  It has a good overall flavor and texture to it, which can actually vary in saurkraut despite the general simplicy of the ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "As someone who grew up eating saurkraut, its a treat to be able to buy this German brand and get something as close to homemade-tasting as you can purchase at the store.  It works well cold or warm, though most people tend to prefer it heated up.  You can also do what my grandmother used to do and saute porkchops and then simmer the cooked chops in the saurkraut before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Works well as a side to most beef or pork dishes and, obviously can be spooned onto hot dogs or be served with sausages.  Go on, try some of this at your next BBQ!  Sure, you can buy cheaper saurkraut--or go to the trouble of making your own--but I think this version is well worth the price. EXCELLENT...THIS IS A GREAT FIND...EASY TO OPEN JAR LOTS OF GOOD STUFF...I AD THIS TO THE REST OF THE STUFF IN THE CROCK POT AND ITS AMAZING AND VERY SIMPLE AND JUST LIKE I WANT TO EAT SAUERKRAUT EVERY DAY...ITS FANTASTIC Cudos for using pounds instead of ounces and tricking us.  Pounds sounds like you get a lot more but you get the same ounces.  Bought on pound basis and haha ya got me this time.  Hope this caviar sourkrout is as good as its premium price. They were dry. Not fresh at all! Do not waste your money like I did! These were a gift, but they received rave reviews from the recipients upon arrival. They recommend warming them briefly in the microwave! This was a gift. They raved about how good each flavor was. These were a gift. Feedback is the cookies are very tasty. My only issue is the lack of a gift wrap option from the vendor (when ordering through Amazon). I understand why this may be an issue but would think some means of handling this could be created. WARNING: chewy and addictive.\n",

      "Those were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten!!! I'm just disappointed in the fact that I only ordered one tin... I need more!! They were actually ordered as a gift, and thank God the recipient was pleased as well. I will definitely be purchasing in the future. - I had the oatmeal raisin. I buy these every year for gifts and everyone raves how good they are. I don't think these are very good cookies. Not worth the money at all. Dare I say that these cookies are every bit as good as most bakeries produce.  Yes I dare.  These are scrumptious. Great gift for someone. Nicely wrapped. Home made looking cookies. Taste awesome. Well received on a relative's birthday.  Would have been better if a gift card was available.  There was no indication who sent them. These were revolting and made everyone sick!  Mustve been spoiled.  Gross.  We threw away half of them when we realized we were getting nauseated because of them.  I do not remotely recommend since you cant return food and these were funky and nasty. Great tasting cookies. Fast delivery. The cookies come in a nice tin. Great aroma blessed me as soon as I opened the well packaged box.  They are so fresh.  The instructions said if you're not going to eat within next two to three days, to freeze them.  There are six layers of fresh baked, yummie, scrumptuous cookies.  I ordered the variety package.  I can hardly wait to taste all the different flavors. I will definitely be ordering these cookies again.  Great job! Nice variety and moist This was used as a gift.  They truly enjoyed the wonderful cookies. Delicious! Will be ordering again soon! I sent these to my daughter. She loves them and I wanted to cheer her up while she is in school, they arrived badly broken. When they contacted me to thank me for my business I told them they arrived broken. They sent her another tin of cookies ASAP! Thanks so much 5 stars  just great costumer service and a fantastic cookie These cookies are so tasty and chewy and fresh!!  Tastes so homemade!!  I just received my second tin of the m&m's cookies..equally as good! These cookies  are  delicious . There  are  many  chocolate chips  and  the  cookies  are  nice  and  soft . The  packaging  is  good  and  keeps  the  cookies  fresh  even  after  the  can is  opened . If  you  are  a  cookie  monster  like  me  you  will  be  happy  with  this . Ordered as a Birthday gift & the recipient loved these cookies. They were gone quickly. Would order these again! Saben a viejas Love these cookies!! Great taste, packaged well, not a broken one in the bunch. These were just okay. I ordered some of the jumbo peanut butter cookies about a week before I ordered these I think. Those were delicious and fresh. These cookies were not as fresh as my first order with the company. I made my first order directly from their site, but I ordered these through Amazon. I'm going to place another order directly from their site to see if that makes a difference as far as quality goes. I ordered these twice and in both cases the people loves them! Fantastic thanks Seem very Fresh! Delicious and soft.\n",
      "Recommend ordering from  Amazon rather than other places, much fresher here. Delicious. The sugar cookie is sooo yummy! given as gift....response: \"best raisin oatmeal cookie\" You would be better off making them yourself...even if you got it wrong it would be better than this stuff.....Save your money and time..zero stars..and that's to much... Didn't have these myself - I sent them to coworkers in another state. They thanked me for doing that, so they must have been fine ;) Great!  Finished off the tin in one setting with 4 people!  Everyone loved them.  My favorite was the oatmeal which surprised me because usually I like choc chip better.  All of the cookies were wonderful Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price. Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days. The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet. The result is a beautifully browned, light, crunchy, low fat, flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon, orange roughy, tuna, chicken or even rib eye steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fisherman's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad, scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad. I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham, tomato and lettuce sandwiches, BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps. It also makes a quick and tasty salad dressing using olive oil and apple cider or balsamic vinegar. The uses for this wonderful spice blend are limited only by your culinary imagination. I sent them to my son. He lobtf them. The cookies were awesome and fresh, I really enjoyed them! They arrived fast and on time and was wrapped really well. I will definitely be ordering more! The cookies arrived in a timely fashion and they were packaged well enough that the cookies were each non crumbled.  These cookies were absolutely delicious and should be considered addictive.  I will definitely purchase more cookies from this vendor; in fact, I already have. I ordered a 2 pound tin of assorted David's cookies for a 95-year-old  birthday girl. She and her family and birthday guests say that every type of those cookies is delicious -- cannot pick out a favorite. So I guess I'll have to keep sending the assortment! Thank you for making my dear friends so happy! Not that great. Certainly not worth the cost. To be honest, the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better, far fresher cookie.  I wouldn't waste my money on these. Excellent Cookies.  We ate them very quickly and yes I will have to reorder. The recipients were very pleased with these cookies.  Just like, or better than homemade\n",
      "and such a nice assortment! Always a great option for any kind of seafood or vegetables. Grandson loved them ....he's at school . Best seafood seasoning I have ever used.  My son also uses it at college, he took it with him and uses it on both seafood and tofu! Outstanding seasoning.  I use it on just about everything - chicken - veggies  - fish.  This truly is an all-purpose seasoning I bought this to try it on boring fish. Well, I found this is not just for fish. The name Seafood Seasoning fools you. I use it in everything from soups, chicken, veggies,baked potatoes, sweet potato fries, eggs and on and on. It does have a lot of wonderful ground black pepper in it so be sparing at first and simply don't buy it if you hate black pepper. I can't live without it now so don't buy it all, save some for me. Highly recommend this seasoning. It's delicious! Addictive cookies! Amazing! Fresh and delicious. The cookies were soft exactly the way I like them. Cookies were not bake right. It was like eating raw cookie dough. Fifty percent of the cookies arrived broken in pieces! Some of the cookies were not that good(Peanut Butter,Macadamia White Chunk). My local Publix Supermarket has better cookies at a fraction of the price! All considered, not worth the price! Delicious as always Fresh. Packaged great. Love the tin canister can be used for anything to keep junk in. These are fresh baked and I mean fresh. They smelled warm and they were right out of the ovens. The packing is wonderful also. Very safe. These are almost on par with the special cookies that you find in the malls. BUT you won't find the freshness in them unless you catch them when they're first taking them out of the oven. Delish I didn't enjoy them because they are to soft, I gave then away Plus they took forever to arruve delicious cookies said the receiver! These were a gift to a cookie monster of a guy... He loved them. Delivery was a little delayed but the address was very rural, so it's not unexpected. too sweet. Not that tasty. But i am comparing to Mrs Fields. wonderful,  tasty and moist love it I ENJOYED THE COOKIES VERY MUCH, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE PRESERVATIVE FREE. I PLAN TO PLACE ANOTHER ORDER. Without a doubt, the best cookies ever.  I purchased the variety tin to see which I liked the best.  Oatmeal raisin were my favorite but wouldn't refuse any of them.  Large cookies, chewy and delicious and the chocolate chip ones had huge hunks of chocolate.\n",
      "I honestly rate these a A++++. Excellent variety of cookies.  They arrived on the day promised.  Sent as a gift...they loved them! David's Cookies did it again! These cookies were delicious and delivered on time! Thank you David's, you certainly have a return customer! I've purchased 8 tins of the large soft assortment and ate them all myself.  They are incredible. I sent these to my niece in N.C.  She said they were delicious. Freshly backed and soft and chewy.  What's not to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrive very fast and I could have sworn I felt the heat from the cookies when I opened the tin can. :) These are the best cookies . They arrived moist! Its about time Spanish products started getting their due.. The most famous (rightly so) Spanish cheese, Manchego, is world class, and is really tough to beat.  Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.  Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores.  They have great specials and offers, so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan.  Regardless, Manchego cheese is so good, you'll undoubtedly be back for more.. and more..  and more. Cookies came package very well and might I add delicious cookies nice and soft I had to place another order love them. I ordered these as gifts for friends and when I asked to try one, were already gone!!!  Everyone loved them! Good flavor, Mild and creamy. Tasty. I use it in so many dishes. Will be buying it again. Excellent! I am so happy I can find such delicious cheese here on Amazon as it is not available anywhere near where I live. Bland and tasteless.\n",
      "It is not the product in the picture, it is a lower quality variety Very oily. so love cookies but don't have time to bake them\n",
      "these are heavenly just right texture great with a glass of milk or cup of coffee. If you treat your dog to a tiny bite (no more) pick out the chocolate bits. (about the size of a quarter)\n",
      "for a hundred pound rottie it's fine. Enjoy! beautifully presented and packed to stay moist!\n",
      "Don't forget that raisins are poison to dogs so no oatmeal raisin for Fido please! Wow is this stuff yummy! I think it's pricy for what you get but it is tasty. The box arrived a few days ago. It was double packed with ice packs between both layers. The ice packs were completely melted, and the cheese were warm, but it wasn't runny. They need to either use larger ice packs or some kind of temperature retaining item for packing so it won't get so warm in the summer. Otherwise, it arrived on time and, did I say it was tasty? Again our cheese is amazing.. thank you This is an exceptional sheeps cheese.  I cannot eat regular cows milk cheese due to lactose intolerance however sheep and goat have become my main stay.  I have been expanding my horizons and eating more cheeses from other countries. The flavor and taste is nice and mild and yet is filling creamy and luscious Just fine. Tastes great. Excellent cheese. I love Monchego, this is. Good one. It makes awesome grilled cheese toasts Good Manchebo at a fair price.\n",
      "Steve Liebmann Arrived on time, fresh, and taste great Sent David's cookies as a gift to my son in college.  He loved them. It has long been a favorite cheese.\n",
      "Cheese is always a good as ever. it was really really good Loved them Good Seller, the best pickles made! I love, love these pickles!!  I started eating them in Germany and so happy that they have them here.  Crunchy and great tasting!!! the best I could have not got anything else better freshly and the taste is awesome Too sweet, not as good as anticipated. Disappointed. These pickles are DEEEELLLLIIIICIOUS!  Crisp and great!  I don't like garlic so I like these very much!!  Don't leave you with bad breath! The best barrel pickles. My supermarket does not carry anymore and kuhne is the new label but always the best. According to an answered question here on Amazon, these pickles do not contain ALUM, a toxic ingredient used as a cheap crispener in most brands of pickles. Cheers! gutt zin pickle very good product this hit the jackpot, great as usual,will order the spicy mix next time, but we used to buy these in Germany, All of David's Cookies baked goods are delicious but I'm a peanut butter devotee and their Peanut Butter Cookies are delicious!  There are no nuts in it, instead there are peanut butter chips -- biting into one of those with the soft, rich PB Cookie surrounding them, is beyond wonderful! I loved this cheese. I will buy it again and again. Thanks. Manchego is a favorite cheese.  In my area, it is rare to find good quality Manchego.  Amazon to the rescue!  This cheese was delicious!! Amazing This is amazing cheese!  Straight from Spain... it's pricey, but worth it.  One of my top favorites. THESE PICKLES ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN AND I WILL SAY THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU. I came across these pickles in a grocery story several years ago and decided to try them. I have not been disappointed. I have been purchasing them ever since. There is always at least one jar of them in my cupboard. The flavor is great. It is not over vinegary like a lot of commercial pickles. Also, I enjoy drinking the pickle juice. The people I have share them with have become converts to these pickles. These pickles are not sweet pickles. They might be bread and butter pickles , but I thought hey were sweet pickles.. I tried these over a friend's house several years ago and was blown away.  So much better than U.S. pickles.  They are the only pickles I buy now.  Crisp, but not hard, very nice subtle flavor.  My only issue is that I bought several jars at once, and didn't use them all right away ... after around a year on the shelf, they loose their crispness and get rather limp.  So enjoy them within a few months of buying them! ok Ordered the pecan/chocolate chunk. Cookies were hard and without flavor. Contacted seller, who responded immediately. Second shipment is wonderful: cookies are soft and taste great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving 4 stars because customers shouldn't have to complain to receive a superb product. The cookies were really good! The first time I bought David's cookies, was from HSN and I have a standing order with them. I get them every month but this David Tin, is great same cookies, Great Taste, same texture, over all the best cookie I have ever had. I highly recommend this cookie. I'm a Cookie Monster from way back and I know my cookies ;*) I was with ebay and the quality did not meet very good cookies The Peanut butter Cookies are Pretty good but not great, the chips make it a little too much, probably would prefer them without the chips... These are really delicious!  Taste like they just came out of the oven! I purchase 2lbs of this M&M cookie product as a christmas gift. When I tasted the cookies when I went over to that person, I was embarrassed by the cookies being too hard and overbaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't terrible, mind you... but I've tasted better at Wegman's. If i had know these cookies were like this, I'd just have bought some freshly made cookies at Wegman's and just wrap it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, this may be normal. perhaps I just got a bad batch. I dunno. But as of today, this rating stands. Always fresh and delicious! A winner with every cookie lover. They were good have a good buttery taste to it Cookies were fresh and tasty. Just wish it there were more, maybe 2.5 pounds for the price. Very close to homemade. I have tried so many different brands of cookies from Amazon and I have to admit: David's cookies are SOOO delicious! I purchased two orders of these cookies (Variety and Chocolate Chunk), in less than a month. They are so soft and a great size! The orders came to my house early, without the cookies being crushed and/or in pieces. So far, these are the BEST cookies I have tried on  Amazon! The cookies are fresh and absolutely delicious.  Some people preferred a cookie that's a bit softer.\n",
      "The advertisement says that they're \"soft-baked\", but I guess the meaning can vary.  I would order\n",
      "them again, and recommend them to my friends. Sent these to my sister. She loved them Next I'm ordering them for myself I gave this as a gift at Christmas, and the recipient is still raving about it several months later! Gift  told that they were very good This is an excellent product & the seller is OUTSTANDING.  We ordered 9 of these for our clients, and had them delivered a couple of days before Christmas.  They were delivered promptly, when promised, and before the holiday.  The quality of the baked goods and the presentation were top notch.  The clients RAVED.  Excellent value for the money!  Excellent baked goods at almost any price.  Also, some of the best customer service around from this seller.  Kudos all round! These were put in a Irish gift basket along with bread, biscuits, mustard, marmalade and beer. Since the recipient is a huge cheese lover, these cheeses were a big hit! If you are looking for traditional Irish cheeses and other products, you don't have to look any further than this company. Their selection of products directly from Ireland are wonderful. They even sent me a gift certificate to use on the next purchase I made from them. So if you're wanting real Irish, you will love these cheeses and the many other Irish products this company offers. This is my third or fourth purchase from iGourmet. My first order had a small issue that I just sent them a note about as an awareness, but they went all out and not just resolved it (I was already satisfied), they blew my socks off. Subsequent orders have all been great. I really love the service I get, not to mention the delicious cheese. It's a good thing I can't order 50 pounds of cheese at once, because if I could, I would. Yes, their selections really are just that good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am giving serious consideration to making this year's holiday gift giving cheese to all my cheese loving friends. There are two birthdays in July, and both will be getting a package from iGourmet. If you appreciate a good cheese, iGourmet is the on line cheese monger that should be your go-to guys. (Don't forget to support your local cheese monger too!) Ate them all with in three days. Way too good I wish I had left out oat meal , their flavor was not good and I do not know if there were white chocolate but if that was what they were they did not stand up in flavor like others I have had. All in all we liked the peanut butter and chocolate chip. I do wish I bought just the two flavorss as did others. I ordered this for a close family member, and they invited me to enjoy it with them. Boy, oh boy. I ended up sneaking back to the fridge to munch on this stuff. The Cahills went first, but all of them were enjoyable. Mostly sharper cheeses, but not extra sharp. I LIKE CHEESE A LOT SO I PRETTY MUCH LIKE ALL CHEESES. THIS PACK IS MORE ON THE CHEDDAR CHEESE TASTE. I got them for my wife for christmas and she loves them. I purchased these cookies for my boyfriend he said they they were very soft and delicious Everyone we sent this to as a gift responded with, \"We love these cookies!\" Just buy them... An excellent choice for Holiday Gifts. Made all my friends very happy. YUM! The whole family found a cookie they liked. Fresh tasting...definitely worth the cost! The cherry & white chocolate chunk was my favorite!  I must add - All of the cookies were delicious! Excellent for the holidays, to have around the house or to give as a gift. I will buy more in the future! This was a gift, came in a cute tin for the holidays. The recipient told me the cookies were \"great\" and she is a cookie lover! Third years in a row Product was stale I hate to say just how good they were... I am wearing about 5 lbs more from them  .. Delicious, fresh, like home-made ( actually better) .. the Chocolate chip are AMAZING and the Peanut butter were fought over by my family... great buy.. would make an amazing gift Most of the cookies tasted ok.\n",
      "The main problem was that many of the cookies were broken.\n",
      "Add to the that the bottom layer was very stale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was to be a nice snack gift but turned out bad.\n",

      "First and Last time ever ordering from this company. The best Foods come in small packages, the whole Family Loves these Treats. Outstanding Cookies tasted good, but poor packing and presentation is not what we have previously experienced from David's Cookies. Received some odd shaped, broken cookies. Was a gift.........said they were VERY good.  Fast delivery;  would buy again. REALLY Rich cookies, nice homemade taste, quality and softness. Already gone. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DIETING! We sent four of these cookie bundles to our kids with free gift message.  The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety, and they're definitely moist with a 'fresh baked' look, feel, and taste to them.  When not on sale I think they're rather expensive, but for the price I paid (25% off regular price) I think they were worth it.  My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.  So, if you're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you're sending them on your own as they most likely won't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies. good The cookies were tasty but the last two levels in the container the cookies were all broken.\n",
      "It arrived a day before they said they would. These cookies are delicious! I will buy them again. This was a gift for my 97 year old father in NY. He absolutely loved it. This was his favorite cookies. He recognizes the David name.  Absolutely perfect gift! Nothing better than sending a surprise to someone and hearing the joy in their voice when they call! Of course, mom had to then send me pictures of the cookies they had consumed!  The 2 lb tin of assorted David's cookies arrived well packaged! Not one broken cookie! The cookies were soft, flavorful and tasty!  They enjoyed receiving different flavors and they are already into the second layer!  A total hit! Thank you! What a wonderful treat and I will send these again! God!!!! These are so damn good and FRESH so far my favorite is the Oatmeal raisin cookies and the Chocolate chip cookies they're so good Im definitely ordering more. Gave ad a gift. They were fresh and good. Really good I've tried dozens of cookies from on-line companies and David's are the closest I've found to homemade.  The cookies are not all uniform in size, so they don't look they were machine made.  They arrived well packed and very fresh.  The chocolate chunks are generous and the nuts are fresh tasting. The cookies are soft, but not too soft.  I have no complaints whatsoever and have already placed 3 more orders to send as gifts. delicious I bought these as a gift for my father.  He loves them, and says the cookies are delicious. Quick delivery too.  A bit pricey, but worth it according to my dad. noy really. This was my \"go to\" holiday gift this year.  The cookies were reported as \"the best ever\" by my colleagues, friends and family.  Although two of the tins I ordered were dinged up when they arrived, the cookies inside were undamaged.  Overall, the price is higher than other cookie sellers but so far, seems to be worth it. These are by far the Best Cookies I have ever bought. Usually the label says homemade taste and all I can really tasted is the box mix. However I love \"David's Cookies\". And yes I will recommend these to family and friends and purchase some as gifts.\n",
      "Great, Really Great Cookies!!! Excellent cookies. My guests raved. So good. Moist and chewy. Very good. Positively divine!!!!  Fresh!!!! Yummy for the tummy!!! These were sent to a business as a thank you.  They loved them. Nothing special but an all around good home made cookie. GREAT = 10 Stars no note was delivered with the package my friends did not know they came from me till I called. I ordered\n",
      "these cookies because I have had them before. I thought I ordered chocolate chip cookies,they were\n",
      "assorted. Very yummy cookies.  Nice assortment.  Packed nicely.  Arrived on time.  Recommended Before sending a tin of these cookies to my niece in college I purchased a tin for myself.  I wanted to test the quality of the cookie and the reliability of the delivery.  The entire experience was fabulous!  There was one serious drawback: I am already thinking about reordering the cookies- for me! David's Peanut Butter Cookies are simply incredible.  Everyone I shared them with thought they were delicious as well.  The tin of cookies will make for a wonderful treat for my niece to share with her friends. My sister & her family loved These cookies are by far the best cookies ever especially this Oatmeal Raisin because I bought before the assorted one but I only liked the Oatmeal Raisin flavor among the others and I came back to order it especially. It's not too soft it's not too hard perfect amount of sweat raisins. Go buy it if you like cookies. The recipient reports fresh and tasty. was a gift for my father Yum! Great gift. Delivered on time. Recipient was very pleased. Would definitely order again. I love your cookies and have ordered another 2lb. They are wonderful. But this last order was awful. They all tasted the same. Bland. Cannot eat them. Will NOT ORDER AGAIN> The cookies came on time and packaged nicely. Never mind the fact that the cookies were fresh and delicious. Cookies were very fresh and shipped very quickly. When these cookies were offered to me, I decided my mom needed them for a nice surprise during a stressful and busy time.\n",

      "I ordered the cookies on a Friday afternoon, December 4th 2015, and they arrived in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday December 9, 2015, having shipped on Monday. The box arrived well packed so that the tin, and it's cookies, were not damaged en route. Had these cookies been for me, I would not have minded a little bouncing around, dented tin and broken cookies, but not as a surprise for Mom that needed a good surprise. I feel confident from that experience that you can feel assured they will arrive fresh and intact with less potential to be a gift you have to apologize for.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom is not a baker but she has a sweet tooth and very much enjoys cookies, like most of us. She was much pleased with the variety, while her favorite was the classic American chocolate chip cookies, she ate them all and did not feel the need, or want, to share with anyone. The cookeis are soft with some chew without being cakey or chemically soft that you find in packaged grocery store \"soft\" batches of cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen. The palm oil is great for stability in hot climates, so this will be a plus for shipping in hot weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm very pleased with this order, and it went smoothly, I can recommend ordering from this experience, and I likely will, as Mom has requested more, \"If you get the chance.\" Things to keep in mind, the 1lb size is best for one or two people, an office, group or family would do best with a larger size to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy them.\n",

      "David's cookies provided me with a coupon to try these at a promotional price so that I could share my experience and opinion with you (and Mom's.) This was about the sixth time we ordered the cookies. Very disappointed with this last order. Top layer all broken up.  And not as big as they used to be and when we got to the bottom layer they are all crumbled up. Just not what they were before. Good cookie more flavors want to try but too expensive I have purchased these on three different occasions for gifts and they loved them. They stated they were very good cookies and the containers are nice. great college gift! Great cookies! Delicious Cookies great combination.  Only problem is you keep wanting more. Fast delievery and super fresh.  A++ These are my favorite cookies to order and to send to friends. My mother loved them and said they tasted like they were 'just baked'.  I told her that that was how they sent them - just after baking. They fill your hand; not like some of the ones you order that are so tiny. This selection made a nice, presentable gift. The packaging was very good. The cookie was too sweet. I like a crunchier cookie with more shortening. I did like that the cookie wasn't a soft cookie. The Person seemed to enjoy them they ate them in 2 days loli would have like to try one for myself i guess i will buy again. Cookies arrived in record time and were delicious and fresh.  Everyone in the office enjoyed them as did I.  I'll be back to purchase more when I'm able to afford them.  They are a little pricey but worth the cost!!!!!  Thank you... The oatmeal raisin cookies are the best I have ever eaten. I also sent an order to my mother and she agreed! Thank you for such a wonderful delicious, fresh product. As ALWAYS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT!! David's products are ALWAYS Fresh & Stay fresh longer than most other cookies. These cookies rule! Fresh as can be and very tasty! I mailed them to relatives at Christmas with other gifts and guess what they all said? Those cookies were the best! Didn't last one day! Wonderful cookies, tasted homemade. Very good, big cookues. Saved myou day, I was sick, could not make any, they got them here on time! They disappeared in less than 30 minutes. I ordered this as a gift for our resort office staff and they were thrilled!  So thank you for helping me make their holiday season a bit more delicious! The cookies were moist and had a lot of raisins. Very good. Gave five stars the first time I ordered this,and I'm giving it Five stars again! This time I ordered 2 pounds. I'm ordering more for friends,as Christmas presents. Next time I will order a wheel. Soooo good. Will definitely order again. Unbelievably great. The best , but pricey. After you cut off the rind , it is a shrinking pound cut. great and testy Found cookies to be so so and ok. Certainly far from the best. Dont agree with rave reviews. Large homemade style with fresh tasting cookie dough and large chocolate chunks throughout the cookies. Taste delicious. My iGourmet order arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The Spanish cheeses are expensive, but of incredible quality and flavor. A quick web search will turn up some fantastic ways to eat each cheese, ranging from marinated in olive oil and herbs (Idiazabal), to served with dried fruits and nuts (Mahon), diced and added to a tomato-based salad (Murcia al Vino), and even coated and fried (Manchego). I definitely recommend picking things that will highlight the flavors of each cheese rather than obscuring them, as these are truly delightful. Okay some were broken up but tastes great. Like a bakery ones used to get. I love the double chocolate chip and chocolate chip cookies. Like how they are stacked with paper dividers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got these on discount for honest opinion. Really are great not too sweet. I will definitely buy more. Excellent product and service Excellent Cookies! Excellent Cookies! Have sent these to my parents out of state twice now, and they loved the cookies both times.  Customer service is wonderful too, I had failed to provide a street address, and they called and emailed me to get one.  Great company with a great product. Will definetly order again. yum Just fine. Tastes great. One of my favorite cheeses.  Manchego is mild with a good texture and should appeal to anyone who appreciates real cheese. excellemt product excellent product I'M A RETURN CUSTOMER, BECAUSE THESE COOKIES ARE THEEEEE BEST!!!\n",
      "OATMEAL RAISIN & PEANUT BUTTER ONES ARE PERFECT TOO!!! Really enjoyed these. Tasty too! Once sold in Japan. No longer. Was great to find them online. I am a fan of David's Cookies. It may be the butter content because they are far\n",
      "more tastier than other chocolate chip cookies. Put them in a microwave for ten seconds and they will melt in your mouth. I got this for a gift.  Asked him how they were and he said he inhaled them--figured that meant he liked them. Nice tasting cookies that come in an original David's round tin canister!!!! Did not like these. Tastes very sweet that overpowers the flavor of the cookie. Ended up giving them away. YUM, Great Tasting, went Great with a Glass of wine & a salad.  Thanks Great taste! Arrived in very good shape. Well packaged on shipment. I love this cheese and know it is also free opf additives and healthy to boot! A good cheese.\n",
      "A long time favorite eats chicheu.\n",
      "Highly recommended. EXCELLENT. WILL ORDER AGAIN Perfect! Live in Bush Alaska and had a serious craving for good cheese. The cheese was well packaged and the selection was wonderful. This company truly cares. Thank you. Excellent assortment of cheese. This cheese was very very good. It came well wrapped, fresh and in tact. Will order again Great variety and a good price READ ENTIRE REVIEW:\n",
      "FIRST BATCH FROM ORIGINAL ORDER I STATED:\n",
      " \"I'm sure these are probably good tasting cookies but by the time I received them they were stale.  I'm going to have to contact the supplier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "AFTER CONTACTING SUPPLIER:\n",
      "I did contact the supplier and they apologized and sent me a free 1lb canister of these same cookies and they were wonderful tasting.  So, if you love home made oatmeal raisin cookies these are very very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like suppliers who pay attention to their customers and I believe the first batch was an anomaly!  Give these cookies a try. arrived 2 days ahead of schedule.  mouth-watering taste & aroma.  very well packaged in tin - 5 layers of five cookies separated by thin cardboard, surrounded by bubblewrap & cellophane.  i had ordered the oatmeal-raisin in the past & was very impressed as well.  nice metal tin too. Cookies were great!! took to share with my coworkers.  they were happy i didn't get even one.  bummed out. Yes these were wonderful. I sat and ate them by myself while watching a white Christmas, wishing we had snow.. 29  and no snow! The cookies made it better. White chocolate macadamia cherry.  Lots in the tin, layers of them. Worth every penny. Outstanding! Nice to try something new. I wish the tin was larger though, but I found the cookies different and interesting. I ordered the 24 oatmeal-raisan cookies.  These are the softest, freshest, most delicious ones I have ever tasted.  Enduldge!!! The David's Cookies I bought in Princeton and Menlo Park 25-30 years ago were flattish, mis-shapen, came from light brown dough and were very full of chocolate chunks reminiscent of tobler or lindt chocolate. The things that arrived this week were perfectly round, dome-shaped, made from yellow dough, low on chocolate chunks (which seemed more like baking chocolate), WAY too vanilla tasting, and too chewy.\n",
      "Taste-wise, they were similar to vanilla wafers with chunks of baking chocolate.\n",
      "REALLY disappointing.. Excellent cheese assortment. Promptly delivered. Very tasty,. These were kind of expensive, but tasted fine. They were dry. Not fresh at all! Do not waste your money like I did! These were a gift, but they received rave reviews from the recipients upon arrival. They recommend warming them briefly in the microwave! Excellent taste and texture. Well worth the cost. Packaging was very good. Just be patient on the shipping. Highly recommended. The whole family loved this mix! 1 cheese was not from Spain but we knew they could do that. It was a cheese I had before but it was very good. I had no trouble with that. Anyone wanting to visit a country through their cheese! WTG This was a gift. They raved about how good each flavor was. These were a gift. Feedback is the cookies are very tasty. My only issue is the lack of a gift wrap option from the vendor (when ordering through Amazon). I understand why this may be an issue but would think some means of handling this could be created. WARNING: chewy and addictive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten!!! I'm just disappointed in the fact that I only ordered one tin... I need more!! They were actually ordered as a gift, and thank God the recipient was pleased as well. I will definitely be purchasing in the future. - I had the oatmeal raisin. I buy these every year for gifts and everyone raves how good they are. LOVED IT We all love this cheese and the shipping packaging is the best we've seen. So far, we've eaten 3 orders of this selection of cheeses and the only complaint we have is it taste so good it doesn't last long. Everyone was impressed and pleased with this assortment.  Even the members of my family who are gourmet foodies really liked it.  Terrific gift! :) I don't think these are very good cookies. Not worth the money at all. Dare I say that these cookies are every bit as good as most bakeries produce.  Yes I dare.  These are scrumptious. Great gift for someone. Nicely wrapped. Home made looking cookies. Taste awesome. Well received on a relative's birthday.  Would have been better if a gift card was available.  There was no indication who sent them. These were revolting and made everyone sick!  Mustve been spoiled.  Gross.  We threw away half of them when we realized we were getting nauseated because of them.  I do not remotely recommend since you cant return food and these were funky and nasty. Great tasting cookies. Fast delivery. The cookies come in a nice tin. Great aroma blessed me as soon as I opened the well packaged box.  They are so fresh.  The instructions said if you're not going to eat within next two to three days, to freeze them.  There are six layers of fresh baked, yummie, scrumptuous cookies.  I ordered the variety package.  I can hardly wait to taste all the different flavors. I will definitely be ordering these cookies again.  Great job! Nice variety and moist This oil is light and delicate yet flavorful.  Not the most robust oil I've tried, but that's not always desirable anyway.  I will be buying this oil again and I recommend it to anyone who cooks with olive oil often. This was used as a gift.  They truly enjoyed the wonderful cookies. Delicious! Will be ordering again soon! Pretty gouda stuff.  One of the cheddar products we have tried to date.  Nice packaging and arrived in very good condition.  The cheeses may vary from sampler to sampler I don't know...  Ours had gouda, roquefort, cheddar and what looks like swiss.  We have tried the cheddar and it was very very good, quite sharp and tasty albeit a bit on the crumbly side.  Trying the others a bit at a time as we go along.  Great for sandwiches and mouse traps. I am not a cheese expert nor do I claim to be one so this kind of cheese is new to me.  If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.  It was a nice way to taste the way different cheeses from different places vary.  Now that I have the taste for gourmet cheese and its grown on me quite a bit I don't know if I can go back to normal supermarket cheese anymore. Once you taste the cheeses inclued in this set, you will never buy regular cheese from the supermarket again...Welcome to gourmet cheese...simply one of the best cheeses in my opinion...highly recommended... I sent these to my daughter. She loves them and I wanted to cheer her up while she is in school, they arrived badly broken. When they contacted me to thank me for my business I told them they arrived broken. They sent her another tin of cookies ASAP! Thanks so much 5 stars  just great costumer service and a fantastic cookie These cookies are so tasty and chewy and fresh!!  Tastes so homemade!!  I just received my second tin of the m&m's cookies..equally as good! These cookies  are  delicious . There  are  many  chocolate chips  and  the  cookies  are  nice  and  soft . The  packaging  is  good  and  keeps  the  cookies  fresh  even  after  the  can is  opened . If  you  are  a  cookie  monster  like  me  you  will  be  happy  with  this . Ordered as a Birthday gift & the recipient loved these cookies. They were gone quickly. Would order these again! Saben a viejas Love these cookies!! Great taste, packaged well, not a broken one in the bunch. These were just okay. I ordered some of the jumbo peanut butter cookies about a week before I ordered these I think. Those were delicious and fresh. These cookies were not as fresh as my first order with the company. I made my first order directly from their site, but I ordered these through Amazon. I'm going to place another order directly from their site to see if that makes a difference as far as quality goes. I ordered these twice and in both cases the people loves them! Fantastic thanks Seem very Fresh! Delicious and soft.\n",
      "Recommend ordering from  Amazon rather than other places, much fresher here. Delicious. The sugar cookie is sooo yummy! given as gift....response: \"best raisin oatmeal cookie\" You would be better off making them yourself...even if you got it wrong it would be better than this stuff.....Save your money and time..zero stars..and that's to much... Didn't have these myself - I sent them to coworkers in another state. They thanked me for doing that, so they must have been fine ;) Great!  Finished off the tin in one setting with 4 people!  Everyone loved them.  My favorite was the oatmeal which surprised me because usually I like choc chip better.  All of the cookies were wonderful I sent them to my son. He lobtf them. The cookies were awesome and fresh, I really enjoyed them! They arrived fast and on time and was wrapped really well. I will definitely be ordering more! The cookies arrived in a timely fashion and they were packaged well enough that the cookies were each non crumbled.  These cookies were absolutely delicious and should be considered addictive.  I will definitely purchase more cookies from this vendor; in fact, I already have. I ordered a 2 pound tin of assorted David's cookies for a 95-year-old  birthday girl. She and her family and birthday guests say that every type of those cookies is delicious -- cannot pick out a favorite. So I guess I'll have to keep sending the assortment! Thank you for making my dear friends so happy! Not that great. Certainly not worth the cost. To be honest, the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better, far fresher cookie.  I wouldn't waste my money on these. Excellent Cookies.  We ate them very quickly and yes I will have to reorder. The recipients were very pleased with these cookies.  Just like, or better than homemade\n",
      "and such a nice assortment! Grandson loved them ....he's at school .\n"

      "No adverse comment. Gift for college student. If you like strong tea, this is for you. It might even be a little too strong for me. Love the tea. The flavor is way better than the regular Lipton black tea. Definetly worth the money. I have searched everywhere until I browsed Amazon and found it!  This is the tea Lipton should be selling on grocery store shelves.  The stuff I last purchased is just awful, and nowhere near as good as I remember. Tea made with Lipton Yellow Label teabags is much better than tea made with regular Lipton teabags. I love this tea!  Okay, I am not a high falutin' tea snob, but I first enjoyed this Lipton yellow label tea when on a trip to Singapore, and whether it was the room service, the company, or the countryit left such a favorable impression on me, I search it out whenever possible.  Maybe it is the same as the USA's white label Lipton tea, but the yellow label tea appears to me to be smoother and more mellow.  I would highly recommend itgive it a try! Discovered this tea at a local Med. Rest.a great tea, have been sharing with friends.  Everyone likes it and will be ordering more.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this tea, otherwise not available where we live. Well I bought this tea after being in Malaysia for several months, mostly to try making teh tarik without using loose tea as we did several times. I failed with regular Lipton black tea, thought the difference must be because of Yellow label. That turned out to be wrong, the problem is the condensed milk which is clearly different in Malaysia than what I have been able to get in the YOU.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say the taste is marginally different than regular Lipton black tea, if you had me do a blind taste test I am not convinced I would be able to know which I was drinking with a reliable success rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered 4 boxes and the packaging was sealed well, but it has this unmistakable dust-like taste that is ruining the tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I have gone through 2 boxes and only the first had the dusty taste. The others are fine, and pretty much taste the same as regular Lipton black tea We really like this tea.  It is definitely different from the regular yellow box of 100 that I get in the stores.  You can tell the difference when you drop them into hot water.  They sink much faster than the regular ones.  In the end, I think they have a somewhat stronger flavor that is good.  I plan to keep buying these. Hard to find in the YOU.S.A.  Exactly as described, good quality. I make the best brewed iced tea with this yellow label Lipton tea. I make it by the gallon using the same amount as regular loose teas. I only add 1/4 cup of sugar per gallon. This tea has quickly replaced soda and tastes even better. After opening, I transfer the entire contents into a glass container (not plastic) with a metal screwed lid to keep the air out. We love this tea and hope Amazon keeps carrying it. I have recently started drinking hot tea again (since my childhood when Grandma made us hot tea with milk & sugar) and have been trying different types and brands of tea to find my favorites.  I cannot speak the tea lover's lingo (full-bodied, smoky with hints of arsnic, etc.) but this tea is decent.  I use it mostly to make iced tea but I drink it hot occasionally too.  I have been completely spoiled on Dilmah tea & now any others seem inferior.  Lipton Yellow Label is definitely better than PG Tips! I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste.  I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas.  I probably will not buy more of this tea since there are so many others out there to try but I plan to use up the rest of what I bought.  If anyone wants some PG Tips let me know & I will send it to you for the price of shipping!! I like pretty much all of Lipton's tea I just do not see any difference from this tea to all the other types on Lipton loose teas. I was watching a youtube video about buying tea in New York and there was a guy from somewhere in the Pakistan, Afghanistan area who went to tea shops serving their ethnic choices of tea. In one of the shops they prepared I think it was called Kashmiri tea, I watched them put the ingredients in and they used this box of tea. I liked the final product. I tweeked the ratio of ingredients to my liking. Long story short, this tea is potent and I think only best for hot tea. it was ok, but it did not taste like the Lipton of my youth that i loved so much. Maybe Iv'e just become too much of a tea snob! Great taste use it for cold brewworks great. Excellent flavor-- I cold brew and mix  1/2 tsp lemon juce with THM sweetener blendsgreat!!!! Best tea for my single cup coffee maker. I purchased stainless steel single cup reusable. Make fresh tea every time. So much better than tea bags. Good tea. Way better than baseline Lipton tea. The baseline Lipton tea is more of a powder, where this tea is in a granular-form. It brews much better/more efficiently. It has a really deep (almost chocolate-like) flavor. Much deeper/more potent than their bagged tea. I usually prefer Lipton teas, however, I did not give it 5-stars because while it is good, it is not as good as some others (Tetley, PG Tips, Taylors and Peet's, now Mighty Leaf. Orange Pekoe tea is considered (in the YOU.S.) as a budget tea and not a premium tea. This Lipton tea is priced accordingly. This tea looks like coffee grounds. Brewed it once and threw it out. OK tea. My second favorite tea!  Drink lots it will make your day better.  It is not for tea drinkers who like weak tea.  It is dark and rich. Excellent product, price, shipping. Half yellow label and half black tea brewed in a French coffee pot works perfect for my taste excellent Less bitter than the Lipton black tea sold in most US supermarkets Good tea flavor. Not the best I have ever had, but it is good, and the price is very reasonable. I am happy with this tea as an addition to the various teas I keep. The tea is wonderful. I cannot find it in any regular store near me. My only problem, and it is a big one, is these were to be gifts but that is very hard when there is a big price sticker on the front of the box. I wrote the review for this tea for the other regular liptons\n",
      "great stuff, blends well with flavored creamers\n",
      "less bitter holds up well when strong\n",
      "taste good with various water and various brewing methods and strengths\n",
      "a good everyday drinker\n",
      "I will buy again , and again, and , again. This is the best flavor tea for iced tea I have found.\n",
      "Add a little jasmine tea or other flavoring. Most pre-flavored teas are too strong flavoring.\n",
      "Use this tea with a small amount of valilla or other tea, and you can get a great iced tea with just a hint of other flavor! this tea is the bomb, for the real die-hard industrial-strength tea drinker who likes their tea indian or middle eastern style (especially when sweet, though no milk for me, please). clear, robust, flavorful, it brews up a lovely red liquor in less time than it takes to find your favorite teacup, and is also a great base into which to blend more expensive teas (kusmi russian evening or morning tea, for example) for special occasions--like this beautiful may morning's breakfast on the porch. if i were an ancient egyptian and i were leaving instructions for what to put in my tomb to supply the afterlife in amenti, i would ask for this. lots of this. amen. This is NOT the regular Lipton's Tea sold in the USA.  This Lipton's Yellow Label Tea is what most of the rest of the world drinks when they drink Lipton's.  It is not acidic as is the regular USA version we all know (IE: no pucker/dry mouth).  It is bold, but mellow--sometimes with a hint of smoky flavor.  We first drank this while living overseas, I love this Yellow Label tea.  It is very good made as hot tea as well as iced.  Very good with milk or cream.  I have purchased this for years and will definitely purchase this again! We discovered 'Yellow Label' tea while in S.E.Asia. It was strong, consistently fresh, but never bitter. The tea comes as tiny rolled leaves (ie: balls). Even after brewing it remains as balls-- easier to get out of the cup than leaves. suits my taste perfectly.  it is a robust black tea.  best if you buy the loose tea rather than the tea bags. My husband and I enjoy this loose orange pekoe tea.  It has a more committed flavor than the tea bags, which we are happy to have. I bought this because I miss the taste of the Lipton tea I grew up with. When I was young, Lipton tasted so pure, and you had to hurry and take the tea out of the hot water before it got too strong. It also had more of a clear, astringent quality. Hard to explain. So I have not had that experience in a long time, no matter whether I buy the bags or loose. Has Lipton changed since I was young? (I am talking 1960s-70's- maybe later.) I have noticed a lot of food items have changed quality since then and have used cheaper ingredients and / or you get less. Anybody else remember a difference in the old Lipton? I thought buying the loose from Europe (which I think this is) would be better, but it is not. Glad I have some nowthis is tough to find at the local store.  Makes a nice cup of teaif you know what you are buying you will enjoy this, if you are used to loose leaves or little bags filled with powder then try a smaller size first to see if this is what you like.  I love it - I like a full bodied cup of tea and this fills the cup\n",
      "perfectly--I have already ordered this product over\n",
      "and over again--Amazon has a great price so give\n",
      "it a try I know you will like it--it is very rich, full cup of\n",
      "tea. Now as sweet and fragrant as the regular Lipton Orange Pekoe tea bags sold in the supermarket. I was disappointed. Excelente The best coffee ever I love it been using this coffee for years and love the taste i did not realize it was so full of sugar and powdered creamwhich i would not use\n",
      "  i would sometime like to try one without sugar and powdered cream.more healthy\n",
      " that way as i thought this Organo gold company was all about health Yum! enjoy this coffee and have not been able to buy from Organo. Thanks The Oregano Cafe Supreme is a really wonderful cup of coffee. My two favorite coffees are the Norwegian cooffe and Oregano Cafe supreme. In my travels around these are the two coffees I have enjoyed the most. I actually take them with me when I travel. I love the one in the black box and all of the benefits. More energy. Great taste with non diary creamer. No sugar necessary. It is worth the price. Actually I used the black box. The gold cafe supreme was not suitable for me. I have both the red and green curry paste.  The green is milder.  I use both of them in variety of dishes and often spice up soups and stews that need a little zing.  It is so convient to have them in the frig. I live in Puerto Rico and cannot find Thai food here, let alone ingredients.\n",
      "I bought this and the red curry paste too. I had never made my own curry\n",
      "before, but with the help of this, I made restaurant quality curry!  There is quite\n",
      "a bit of product in the container, so it will last if refrigerated.  Watch the shipping\n",
      "costs from outside vendors. They will not combine shipping in some cases. Use very sparingly unless you love very spicy food! Super tasty! I LOVE this curry paste.  It beats Thai Kitchen hands down, I bought that recently in a pinch and I was SORELY disappointed.  This container is HUGE and will last you FOREVER.  Seriously, I have this in green, red, and yellow, and one container will last me several years.  It may be different for you depending on how often you make curry.  The ingredients for this paste are clean and are whole30 and paleo compliant.  The flavor is amazing, and I usually only need about 1 tbsp of this paste to deliver all of the robust flavor I need.  This container is about the size of a pint of ice cream, but not as tall.  But yes, it is large.  The paste comes in a sealed plastic bag inside of the plastic container.  I just cut a corner off the top and squeeze out what I need.  I store the rest folded up in the plastic container and keep it in my cabinet with my other spices.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this stuff is and how nothing compares. Has good flavor, but flavor should be stronger.  Spice is stronger than flavor. Absolutely LOVE this!!! It is spicy but sooooo flavorful. My hubby is a try curry fan (he is a brit) and he LOVED this. Once container is enough to make 4-5 good sized meals. I will not buy any other curry paste again! I love this stuff but you got to be really accurate in how much you use.  I like my soups spicy but I have made it too spicy and salty by adding too much.  This will be a staple in the fridge though. This comes in a sealed plastic bag within the carton, cut it open and squeeze or spoon it in the lidded container. I have made several curried soups, vegetable and chicken dishes and am so pleased with the intricate flavors. This Mae Ploy brand has more heat than other green curry pastes I have used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fabulous flavor and a generous amount, fast delivery and a good price. tastes authentic I like it, but it is definitely more spicy than I was anticipating!  Once I use up this green curry, I will probably try the red. be warned this is very spicy..do not use the recommended amount on the package.use much less. Did not expect that homemade green curry can taste this professional. Actually very delicious, especially with meat and vegetable cooked in coconut milk! favorite brand of curry paste Great Product I ordered both the green and red curry pastes made by Mae Ploy after reading a recommendation in \"Sous Vide at Home,\" a great book that I have on Kindle. I make red curry dishes frequently and always used Thai Kitchen brand. But the teeny jars were not to my liking and I was not crazy about their green curry. The Mae Ploy red is super, but it was the green that is our new favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used it for the first time last week when I was preparing dishes for a private-chef client who is on a low, low carb diet for his recently diagnosed diabetes 2 and wanted to make him something punchy and flavorful. Not only did he love the dish, but he gave some to his mother-in-law (who is also diabetic) and she loved it, too. My husband cruised by the kitchen when I was cooking, intrigued by the delicious aromas and was disappointed that it was for Bruce and not for us. So over the weekend, I made green curry halibut and shrimp \"burgers,\" and they were such a success I am making the same thing for Bruce's wife who is a pescatarian; the first dish featured chicken thighs..\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that Mae Ploy uses all real ingredients in their curry paste and the generous amount in the package means I do not have to go through lots of little jars. The heat level is perfect. It is hotter than the red, but not so spicy that you cannot taste the other flavors in the dish. And if you cannot tell that I am all about the green curry right now, I am using it again tonight in a pork and vegetable dish for company. We eat a paleo diet with lots of vegetables and with some coconut milk and few other additions to the curry paste plus some meat or seafood, I can make a healthy dish with huge flavors that is easy to prepare. Win, win, win. Superb! This paste is authentic Green Curry Thai paste. I wish it came in a larger size. I have used most of it already and need to order more. I have used it in numerous styles of green curry dishes from meats to vegan and it always turns out \"WOW\" delicious!. If you are pondering this, think no further, you will not be sorry with your purchase if you love green curry. I store this in the refrigerator between uses and it has lasted for months without issue. good Easy to make Thai dishes now with green curry at my fingertips.  Excellent flavor.  My guests are always begging for recipe.  It is so easy.  A couple of Tablespoons and you can transform your vegetables and meats into a family treat! Very hot. Use just a tiny bit in soupsadds a bitetoo much, and it overwhelms the soup. The 14oz containers are a great value. Good flavor. Mae Ploy seems to be a bit salty/heavy on the Fish Sauce. So I chunk up a couple potatoes and put them in the curry as it simmers, and that absorbs a lot of the salt. This curry paste has a bit of kick, so taste it first before adding your own ginger, galangal, or hot chili peppers. Lasts for months in the fridge, no worries. I absolutely love this curry paste. I just got a new shipment of green, red and panang. It lasted from June of 2015. Kept in its bag and original cup in the fridge.  Green is the hottest and all have very distinct  and different flavors. It is easy to whip up a tasty, authentic dinner, usually with cubed chicken and eggplant or zucchini, carrots and bamboo shoots. I like it hot, so I use a good amount. If you do not like spicy, use very sparingly but be prepared for less flavor.  Serve over cooled Jasmine rice This is good stuff! But if you cannot take the heat, like my family cannot, just use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. Then it is the perfect amount of heat and spice. ok Def the best of all Mae Ploy's curries. Very easy to make very good Thai food now. My favorite.  Keeps in your fridge for ever.  Flavor is spot on.  Exactly what I ordered.  This is the one to buy. Love this line of curry paste. Great stuff. I am so happy for this brand. I have not the patience to make all my own seasonings for all the curries, and these pastes have been a headache saver. I do not have to store spices that will go bland with this. Just keep in the back of my fridge and it is ready to use when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not being a huge fan of Green curry previously, but knowing I love this brand, I got this for a recipe. It is fantastic. Probably my new favorite. We make a noodle soup dish with veggies and it comes out tasting like my favorite soup: Tom Kah. But without any additional ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much recommend all their flavors, but this one is spectacular all on it is own. By far the best pasted I have used, even better if you purchase lime leaves to add to the mix. Best green curry paste. A little goes a long way. Unless you want to burn your mouth out, add in small quantities. Has a great flavour! Love it. Tastes great, authentic. Comes shrimp curry, friends loved it. I have always made my own curry but it is pointless to spend all that time when this goodness is at my fingertips. I used to spend hours cooking down the spices but this just needs chili oil and some coconut cream and you are ready to go. I highly rec buying a jar of the kaffir  lime to sprinkle on top. I bought all three flavors. It is super hot and concentrated flavor, making it very economical to use. Most recipes call for 3 tablespoons for a four person dish, but I can only withstand one taablespoon in a full recipe. 14 oz is a lot of curry paste. I have had it in my refrigerator for one year and it is still good and strong. With so much spice and heat, it will not spoil. Wonderful This brand is ok if you like it really  (REALLY) spicy. But it is so bland that you have to use a lot of it. By that time it is too hot too eat and still does not have a lot of flavor that I am used to in the traditional Thai dish. Delicious.  Makes a ton of curry! Love this and the Red Curry.  Very simple to make.  Put about 2 tablespoons in a pot with tablespoon of Oil, heat it up and stir then and add whatever meat and veggies you want with about 2 cups of coconut milk.  I can have a meal in about 15 minutes. I was glad to find some Thai \"green curry paste,\" since we have moved to an area with far fewer Asian products available.  In the past, I have had the powder (\"phuket\"), and frankly, I would rather have it in that form.  One thing I thought was odd with this product is that it comes in a plastic bag, so you need to squeeze it out into the jar for storage.  The paste is really thick, so it is a minor chore.  I guess the plastic bag is more secure in shipping than if they covered the inner rim in plastic, like so many other companies do. Good yellow curry paste ,flavor is excellent Small container a bit pricey My husband likes it. I was not too thrilled with shrimp paste but decided to try it because there is no gmo soy or canola like the other new variety I was considering. I usually buy miews flying pan or marions kitchen.\n",
      "It is waaaaay to spicy. Especially for western pallets. I love spicy food but we used 1/4 of recipe on package and still unedible to me. My husband has a cast iron stomach, I still will order med hot to hot at ethnic restaurants just fine.\n",
      "I did not like the spice seems to be red chile in favor and not curry spice.\n",
      "I also found this very oily and do not know why. Somewhat hot if you use as much as the directions suggest (you will need a magnifying glass to read the directions). Very good paste for curries. great product for a good price! I have ordered this before.  Very good flavor, This is the real deal. Authentic and delicious. Not a lot of fillers like some brands. It is pretty much solid spices. Just be aware that it is pretty spicy, unless you only use a little. We followed the cooking directions carefully, but the curry did not turn out so well. It was 1) super spicy, 2) extremely watery, and 3) no flavor. Quite disappointed. I am sure we just need to tweak the recipe a little and adjust to taste at our next attempt at perfecting this dish. Despite the disappoint, this paste is really authentic and smells so good. Our entire apartment smelled like heaven as the paste was slowly bubbling on the stove. Also, it is much more expensive on AmazonI found the exact same thing at my local Korean market for about $2.50. We love it! Awesome, strong, curry flavor. Best one we have had so far! Great tasting curry with many possible uses. This stuff is HOT.  But it has serious flavor, too.  I find I want to eat it more than once a week.  Start out using a quarter of that suggested on the label.  I will be a MAE PLOY fan until  . a great product This tastes just like in Thai restaurants great Love green curry and this is very tasty. Love this product a little goes a long ways taste so good I made a chicken and coconut Thai soup today! Really good green curry paste: we think it has a good balance of green curry elements.  Combine this with some coconut milk, add whatever else you want (garlic, ginger, nampla, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass) and you are on your way. Great to add a nice Thai element to other dishes too. Use sparinglyvery spicy and hot We only use Mae Ploy curry pastes, and green is definitely our favorite. We also get panang and yellow, which are also 5-star, but we just prefer the green over them. Has the best ingredient list of all the curries. This jar probably makes 20 huge batches of curry or more, each of which feed our family of three. Wonderful Currylove it.  This helps me to make Green Curry as good as, if not better than any Thai Food place! This green curry tastes so good and can not go wrong.\n",
      "According to the instruction, I have to use Coconut milk for the base instead of regular milk.\n",
      "I m too lazy to drive to asian market to get the coconut milk and it is expensive like 3$.\n",
      "I used coconut oil to stir fry the vegetables and curry then I pour regular 2% reduced fat milk and It really works.\n",
      "The flavor is soo authentic without weird smell. The consistency is good and it goes well with any vegetables.\n",
      "I put broccoli, carrots, mushroom, potatoes.\n",
      "If this is too spicey or too saulty for you, put eggs and stir really well. Makes great curry The best curry paste out there. A little dab will do you and it keeps in the fridge almost indefinitely. I love it, a little bit goes a long way so I freeze it. Best there is for green curry. as described and shipped on time tastey Good stuff. Would order again. yum I have Mae Ploy Yellow Curry and Panang Red Curry Paste and I love them.  So, I thought I would try the green paste.  I do not like it as well as the other two, but it is tasty and very hot.  Next time I make it I will use less than a tablespoon.  I like hot and spicy curry but this made my eyes water!  A tip, though, is to eat applesauce as a side with this and it definitely cools down your mouth. It was bit expensive. Chinese market was a little cheaper.lol I have tried this twice, but failed to make delicious food. A little bit disappointed. Did not say that it contains shrimp Never cooked curry before.  This makes it so simple.  I just follow the directions.  You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want.  I use a heaping table spoon (silverware, not a measuring spoon) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk, and about a pound of meat or shrimp.  It is hot, but not crazy hot.  I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch, and it was way too hot for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats, and I give a partial stir fry to mine, to give it a little color, before adding it to my curry mixture. Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry does not have time to penetrate it.  I use light coconut milk, so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat.  Add sugar and to taste until you get it where you want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as good as the Thai restaurant I eat at!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I will try the Panang next. So many flavors. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries. I should ask them for recipes. Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I want to say two and one half yogurts. It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry. Its all mashed in there. I cut a corner and take out  a little at a time. Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything. Veggies love it that are steamed, scrambled eggs, rice pasta and even fish and meat. Could not say a bad word about this product.\n",
      "The taste is phenomenal and saved me\n",
      "a TON of TIME in that I did not have to make it Beware!  Lots of hot spice.  Use just a teaspoon and adjust slowly.  Personally I prefer the Thai Kitchen brand whivh hss more lemongrass and less heat. This paste is a bit mouth hurting hot, but once I figured out the right mix, it was great.  You cannot beat this for making green curry dishes of any kind.  I may even use this in flavoring some rice. I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste do not really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so) My cousin dorsher loves green curry and Mae ploy Is his favorite he does not need cookware just a spoon because he thinks its pudding, I tried to cook this for him with some dog noses but he screamed at me. \"DORSHER TO DUNGEON! DORSHER TO DUNGEON!\" I guess he feels like he is in a dungeon when offered real food?  Oh well. Mae Ploy Green Curry Paste. I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry: 1) I want it to taste good and 2) I want whomever I am making it for to feel like it is fairly authentic. Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things I have learned using their curry pastes over the years:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It is very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you will learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The packaging does not mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it is actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I have taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Do not go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I have found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I have always figured that they would know best.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I do not believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it is a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper). I love ethnic foods and to cook them. I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment, so I was back to the drawing board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reviews won me over, and free shipping, so I ordered one of each, red and green. Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW! It made me look like a gourmet international chefit is so incredibly good!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was definitely hot, though, which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base. This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always. Along with a can of coconut milk, this marvelous Green curry paste is the foundation for a fairly authentic Thai meal.  Follow the instructions--starting with a little oil, fry 2-4 tab. of the paste for a few seconds to bring out the flavor, add the coconut milk, meat and veggies.  Toward the end, add sugar to taste and, for tartness, add either fish sauce or lime juice.  Enjoy.  Depending on the time I have, I augment the sauce with kafir lime leaves, basil and fresh garlic and/or ginger.  But these additions not needed, but give the sauce a bit more zing. Being newbie to THai cooking, these are great addition to my kitchen. Its tastes really good for vegetable and chicken curry. This curry paste makes a delicious curry.  I just fried up some chicken and vegetables and added coconut milk to this for a delicious dish.  Quite spicy, so if you are looking for something mild, look elsewhere I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I have been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I have only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I am a person who puts salt on bacon. It is actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I will write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!! Excellent strong green curry taste! My husband finished his bowl and said I should open a restaurant!  Great product! I will buy again! If you know what you are doing, (by which I mean, you know how to enhance a curry to draw out subtle flavors), this is a fine product. However, used alone, it is not going to create a dish that blows your palate-mind. It is good, yes, but it is very basic. So, using it and creating a great curry is going to take some finessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have shopped locally, you will know this is a terrific price. Just be prepared to have plenty of essential other ingredients available to make your dish really sing. Had not had green curry before so I bought this to give it a try.  Turned out really good and I loved the heat level I got using 2 Tbs of paste.  I ordered the red paste too but have not gotten to try it yet, but if it is as good at this paste it should be way better than what my grocery store carries. I find myself using this in much more than intended when I purchased ittomato soup, rice dishes, in a sauce for vegetables, you name it.  It occasionally gives me shivers, I kid you not.  I keep it in the freezer and after several months it seems to be staying fresh as well as not turning into a solid chunk. I have used this a lot recently in some of my chicken dishes. I do not use a lot, I do like spicy foods and a little goes a long way. The plus is its in a bag and you can squeeze out what you need.. Yes I will buy more I have purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor. I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand. Great flavorI purchased all 3Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types. I like other styles of Mae Ploy curry paste, but the green just does not work for me. Overwhelming garlic, no heat, and very bland. I would not purchase this product again. Because of Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste, green thai curry has become my signature dish. I am always being asked to make it. Remember that it is very spicy so a little goes a long way. The flavors in this paste are complex and varied and make for a delicious curry. We are living overseas (not in Thailand) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon! Everyone who has had the opportunity to eat this loves thisI like this a lot with green and yellow zuccini, carrots and bamboo shoots with thin sliced turkey breast. Living too far from any real good oriental restaurants is no longer such a bummerjust came back to order more price went up a bit but it is still well worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see some complaints about too saltyI do not think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it is at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)the hot sensation goes away very quicklywe love hot foodalmost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it is less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat. Curry has officially become my FAVORITE food over the past year. I cannot believe I waited 35 years to try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went through all of the grocery store curry pastes and never could find one that had great flavor and spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park! We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry. These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we have recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)\n",

My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored.  I do not do massive amounts of baking, and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture.  However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.  The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things. This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors.  Colors are  vibrant, and do not taint the frosting like some colors can.  These are  simple to use, and do not make a mess.  My only complaint is that I did not  find these years ago.  This is a must have if you decorate often! The gel food coloring is great for ALL colors except black.  It appears to be black and then when you actually squirt out any of it, it is instead a dark green.  This was highly disappointing as I bought this pack entirely for the black gel coloring.  Otherwise the other colors are as advertised and very vibrant. Gluten-free. Does the job!  I switched from Wilton for making hard candy.  Ateco works better and blends quickly during boiling process (no stirring).  For one batch of hard candy I have found that 2 drops (not 1, not 3) is perfect. If you are looking for deep saturated colors, these are the ones for you. I had to use more than I expected while coloring white fondant but the colors were nice and bright and the farm cake turned out beautiful! Caution, wear gloves as these will stain your hands. This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative. They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid thisI am \"returning\" item. I am trying to avoid my children's exposure to yellow 5, red 40 and so onI do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause. This may be fine for someone that does not read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family. I really think this is a great product.  I was leary of buying it over the internet.  Worried that it might spill, or break open and get all over the other products I ordered.  They work great and you really do not have to use a whole lot of the gel. I bought it purposely because it came with black. I needed just a little black coloring and this safed the day.  Great product. I use these to color my macarons. Very vibrant, only need a touch and they are good! The fold and mix really easily into the warm egg meringue. I did a search for Natural (non chemical) food coloring.  This is the first thing that shows up on the list of items.  However, they are NOT natural food coloring.  Loads of Red40, which my daughter cannot have due to ADHD.  More of a fault with Amazon listings than the product or description, but I thought others should be forewarned. These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reviewer stated that they are not naturalthis is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to cleandon't stain after they have been made into whatever craft.\n",

      "Good product for the price! Works perfect.  Made strips and pepperoni sticks,  Just wish it held more meat. Easy to use, and more importantly to clean after using same.  Everything comes apart for ease of cleaning.  Recommend product. I had no idea that lean hamburger could be used for making jerky.  This Jerky Works Kit is amazingmakes it so easy! Inexpensive. Makes uniform strips of jerky. Dismantles for easy cleaning. The included seasoning packets make great tasting jerky. I wish it held a larger amount of meat though. For a pound of meat, you will have to reload about 3 times. The Nesco American Harvest Jerky Works has made jerky preparation a snap! The homemade jerky is comparable to the jerky sticks you can purchase in stores. The process is simple ground meat of your choice, spice and cure. Load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round. Dependent upon your food dehydrator you can have jerky in a matter of hours. Replacement spices and cures can be found at most larger department/retail  stores. Thanks Amazon.com for recommending this product! Excellent product. My fave cough drop. I always keep a stock at home. Specially in cold season. It is hard to find this flavor in any store. Great product! I am using them for the throat, but not for cough. My throat's been dry and scratchy, especially after singing and these little guys have helped! They are a great second choice to the original natural herb drops from Ricola!! These tasty lemon drops are saving my teeth. I have a dry mouth and because of that was getting cavities frequently. My dentist wanted to do a cleaning every 3 months. I suddenly realized after using these good tasting drops with excellent ingredients I have not gotten cavities in 2 years. I am so grateful for this great product that is composed of healthy ingredients. It is also saving me money. love it! very good Good, a bit overpriced for only 19 drops. Good cough drops/sore throat drops As expected Soothing yet stronggreat! Run of the mill. Healthier but boring. Just as promised, timely arrival. I do not produce saliva due to an auto immune disease and the sugar free Ricola help with that. I especially like that they are sugar free Sugar Free19 Ea / Pack of original Ricola Herb Drops.\n",
      "Very good at throat soothing without all the un natural medicine taste of so many other cough drops. Made in Switzerland of all natural ingredients. Same formula for over seventy five years.\n",

      "And and FYI they do contain gluten if that is of issue to you, or those in your household. This stuff is expensive, does not stay soft & loses flavor quickly.  I could deal with all that if it worked but I just do not think it works any better to relieve dry mouth than regular sugar-free gum. I have to start a course of chemotherapy; and my dentist recommended this gum to me to chew during the months I am on chemo. I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes, it is true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly could not hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I am not about to start now!\n",

      "You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.\n",

      "Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It is not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask your dentist if you have any questions. I like chewing gum for my dry mouth, but Biotene is not my favorite: it is expensive, hard to find, and, in my opinion, not any better than many traditional chewing gums.  You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and does not retain flavor or the texture I like, so I do not chew it very long when I use it. I do not like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It is cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I am not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.  Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to she will out so much to keep buying Biotene gum. (I do like Biotene toothpaste , though.) As a dentist I see many patients that have dry mouth as a result of medication use or due to cancer radiation therapy of the head and neck area.  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS.  Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth.  Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.\n",

      "This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Jim \"Konedog\" Koenig, DDS Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I do not know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. This is a great tea. Flavor is good, works well, priced right and fast shipping. If you like herbal teas, try it, you will like it. Yummy and works nicely! I drink this tea at night just before bed. It helps with my respiratory problem. I could breathe. And it helps me sleep as well. Purchasing this item on Amazon was a great idea. Fast delivery. Good price. Great value. Repeat customer of product and enjoy it I love the traditional Medicinals teas, and i especially love the 15% subscribe and save Amazon discount. Works very well . I was impressed with how quickly this started opening up my cold-congested nostrils and even my sinuses. I got this to see if it matched up to the sinus soother. It did not. My husband has a lot of issues and the sinus soother can completely clear him up. This just did not. This tea has helped me through bronchitis twice and whenever I get the sniffles which always goes down into my chest. Plus it tastes really good, too.  I put a bag or two in my water mug and drink it all day. I like Traditional Medicines teas. Nice After coughing for months, I decided to try this tea.  Nothing over the counter helped at all.  I did not like the idea of buying such a large quantity, but when the tea gave me real relief, I was glad for the purchase.  I had enough boxes of tea to share with friends who were also suffering from the flu or colds or allergies going around.  It seemed so amazing that Breathe Easy worked so well.  When I finally went to the doctor, he diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed a daily inhaler as prevention for future attacks.  I will continue to use this tea whenever I start to feel congestion and cough.  This is a product everyone should have in the cupboard just in case. I love this tea, and it does seem to help clear up sinuses, and it tastes great.  I should be drinking it more often. I love, love, love this tea. It is my favorite of the Traditional Medicinals tea. It has a licorice thing going on and I happen to really like that. Not so much a licorice flavor but the chest action that it gives you. It really works. Also, this can make quite a cup of tea. I have one of those mega-mugs and this made even that size maybe like 16oz?- with one bag, still strong and wonderful. If you are sick, asthmatic, or have a tight chest for any reason go for Breathe Easy. It helps, when you have allergies and are just trying to be less stuffed up. great organic caffeine free tea My acupuncturist said Bi Yan Pian is good for allergies and sinus problems.  I suffer from extreme allergies and am going through acupuncture to get rid of my body's reaction to these allergies.  In the meantime going off antihistamines this tea really works wonders. The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins.  Antihistamines dry you making the toxins stay in your body and oh yeah it lowers your immunity so you get sick.  Good reason to go off anithistamines.  This tea tastes very good with the combination; I use honey with ginger and that is amazing.  I will continue using this tea as needed because it works so well if I drink too much I am actually too drybut then the acupuncture is part of that too.  Hope this helps you decide. I have had some breathing problems for a few year and medication only helped so much.  I do not especially care for the flavor warm. I found that brewing the tea letting it coll adding a bit of honey pouring over ice make it quite enjoyable. Does seem to help clear my breathing passages. I breathe so much easier with this tea! It helps me cut my medications in half! Very good product.  I like the aroma and taste and how relaxing it is. My favorite tea for the morning. Mildly sweet with hints of licorice. Wakes a person up gently! This tea works absolutely the best for me when I have upper respiratory congestion related to seasonal pollen. I noticed a significant improvement in my breathing after having this tea. I purchased it initially at a natural co-op grocery. I had been having some lung irritation after being exposed to perfumes as well as automobile exhaust.  After that, I decided to buy more of it here at Amazon. This stuff works. Not sure why, but it does. Helps with the asthma. I drink one of these breathe easy teas each morning, helps with congestion. I drink this every day to support my lung health. This product is does what its says I find having this every morning gives me a boost with breathing. This is my all time favorite tea..love it! Love it By far, the tea that helps with my chronic allergies the best. It is nice to have a cup of tea rather than taking an over the counter allergy medicine. Excellent, as expected I bought this tea for my mom who suffers from pretty bad asthma and thought it might help her a bit. She has told me that its just ok. She has not really noticed an improvement but likes the taste. Better than any allopathic products for colds and allergies. I am happy. ;) Breathe easy actually works to cut down on my nasal congestions when my alleges act up. The flavor is mostly licorice. Have been drinking this tea for years.  I used to get Bronchitis all the time and this was what helped me most with the coughing and congestion.  Even now, when I eat something that gives me mucus, this clears it up right away and I am able to sleep. If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all. If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful! It tastes great (I enjoy it  myself) and it is an effective breathing aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**of course this is not medical advice, this N1 experience. I bought this to compare it against Yogi Tea's \"Breathe Deep\" tea because of the lower cost.  It is pleasant enough but I prefer the Yogi Tea better.  This brand tastes good but seems to be less effective in clearing a cough or congestion than Yogi Tea. The taste of the breathe easy was ok, a little on the earthy side. I did find it cleared my lungs. However, I am prone to migraines and this set off a big one. I had to toss the 6 boxes I bought, ugh. I do not know about the medicinal aspects of this tea, but the flavor is downright scrumptious.  I love licorice root but have high blood pressure, so I am not guzzling down box after box each week.  A few cups a week does not touch my BP, so I keep it to that.  The directions say to steep it for 10-15 minutes, but I am far too impatient for that.  4-6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma.  Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas.  I just wish they were not so proud of them.  ChaChing!  Thanks, TM. Now try to work on that pricing for us, will ya?  Danke. I love this tea, and it is my immediate go-to for congestion. Works better (for me) than DayQuil. I buy it by the case to keep from running out. It is the best natural way to relieve congestion of the sinuses. It has a mild sweet flavor and taken warm/hot sets great in the body. I have been using this for 2 years and now even my family use it, all very satisfied. I have this every night. The bags hold strong. The flavor is consistent box to box time to time. They stay fresh in the packaging. I am going to make some right now. I use a lot of this tea when having breathing troubles.  It is not as effective as some prescription meds but does feel good and seems to help and also tastes good. I had TB when I lived in Mexico in l970/71/72.  I used eucalyptus/licorice tea and actually cured myself.  Since that time, I have used this tea every day as I love the taste of it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their lungs. For those of us with pulmonary conditions [e.g., asthma]  this tea is great!  And, as a tea lover, I have used it successfully  and enjoyed so doing. My husband has asthma. He uses peventative inhalers along with inhalers when an attack occurs. When the attack is severe he will go into the bathroom and turn the shower on hot, to inhale the steam.  Even doing all of this, the attack will continue until I prepare him the Breathe Easy Herbal Tea.  Within minutes after drinking the tea the asthma settles down. I ALWAYS carry a tea bag with me.  I never leave the house to go anywhere without the tea.  IT IS A LIFE SAVER!!!!!\n",
      "Even if you do not have asthma the tea will also help you breathe better with respiratory infections.  Just recently I had the flu for several weeks with much coughing the tea was AWESOME.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BREATHING AILMENT. As soon as I take a sip or two I can feel a sort of wash and openness in my lungs.  Definitely causes one to \"breathe easy.\"  Have a hot tea or add a tea bag or two to your iced tea bags.  Very healthy stuff in there. Awesome candy, but it is nearly impossible for me to stop with one bag, LOL! I will be buying these again, no doubt much sooner than I should need to. Whoppers Malted Milk Balls is one of my favorite candies. I like the 1.75 oz packages because it is the perfect size snack. Huuge Saving sent  it fast and  an excellent job. My whole family adores Whoppers and have for as long as I can remember. They are the perfect mix of malt and chocolate all in one little ball. What is not to like??\n",
      "\n",
      "The price here on Amazon saved me a small fortune on this batch, wish they have them on Subscribe and Save for this steal of a pricebut I am happy to have gotten this deal even if not! Thanks, Amazon! What can you say about Whoppers Malt Balls except that they are whopping good.  I received my shipment on time and in perfect condition to give out on Halloween. Either you love them or you do not. I guess there is nothing in between. I love them. I love the malty taste in combination with the milk chocolate. One package is considered to be one serving size and just enough to be a perfect treat at no more than 220 calories per package. Good price Not as good as I remember.  The chocolate is rather underwhelming. There whoppers, cannot mess that up. LOVE WHOPPERS AND WHAT A PRICE Excellent Their a bit smaller in diameter than I remember,  but so are candy bars the taste is satisfying and only one carton remains in the pantry. I love malted milk, whether it is in malted milk balls or on milk shakes. And of all the malted milk balls I have ever tried, WHOPPERS Malted Milk Balls are easily the worst quality, junk candies. For years they have had unacceptable numbers of duds; they have also been made of inferior ingredients, including hydrogenated oils and fats, which are horrible because trans-fats cannot be properly digested by the human body. I would love to see a candy company put out a decent brand of malted milk balls. Sadly, WHOPPERS are, in my view, not fit for human consumption. If you do not believe me, check out hydrogenated oils for yourself. But good malted milk balls will cost more, but hopefully you will get what you pay for. Very fresh (BB date 09/2017).  A treat memory from childhood..what fun!  Good thing there are 6 containers because I think the first one may be gone in a couple of days.  Will need to put the rest out of sight (and hopefully out of mind!). It was a gift. They enjoyed them all. These candies did not taste fresh and the surface was not shiny as I have seen it when buying this product in the supermarket. They looked like they had been hanging around for quite a while even though the expiration date had not been reached. Because of the odd taste of the product, I threw them away. Will not buy them again on line. Purchased for my grandson-in-law in the Army overseas. Big Whopper house here.  Love these things.  Fantastic value. Good Kids loved it Always a great snack My favorite  and addictive,  I have never gotten in a stale box here they have always come fresh. I eat them faster than I can buy them Going back to the CRISPY M&Ms Love these! Great product for the price Product works great. Good product, Would purchase again. Delicious, and a good value What more is to be said? After we ordered these we got some really hot days..I was expecting a melted clump..we were delighted to receive them packed securely cold and well insulated !the whoppers are a link to childhood for us..totally awesome. Thanks Whenever I ordered chocolate in the past on some summer day it arrived a melted mess, Packaging HAS IMPROVED and this is my second order from amazon this summer for something chocolate which arrived in pristine condition. One of them came on the hottest day this year temperature approaching the hundreds, it was packed from every angle with cold packs and a huge pillowy cushion. The malted milk balls cannot be beat they taste like I remember good ice cream from when I was a kid. Very fresh tasting all around deliciousthere are a few recipes on the box but I like it as is. Ordered six (6) boxes as a gift. Five for a dear friend, one for me! Though the malted balls were smaller than I rememer they are the same melt in your mouth candy you had as a child. Received my order within a few days and the packing far exceeded my expectations. Would recommend. FYI: You can freeze Whoppers. Take them out of their container and put in a freezer bag. I put my freezer bag back into the waxed Whopper container for easier storage and to protect the candy from freezer burn. The candy did not clump into a solid mass. Will be ordering again. Been eating malted milk balls since my parents dropped off the kids at the movie theater on Saturday morning and tickets cosr $0.35. Arrived in good condition and so far all are fresh. They are frickin Whoppers! My teeth ache sometimes, but I got to have one more! just like I remember as a kid My order was the freshest that I have ever had for Whoppers.  They are a fun product from my childhood memories.  They are very sweet, however.  I had been eating higher quality malt balls (from expensive chocolate stores) as an adult and the sweetness on these is a little overwhelming for me.  But, they were still fun and great to take to the movies.  If you like Whoppers, this was a great package at a great price. love it good These are some of my favorites. We like to munch of these while we watch movies on television. I bought some recently to use in a cookie recipe that sounded delicious but I waited too long to start baking. Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter. I was mad but as usual I got over it. I will try that recipe some other time. Whoppers are just too good to be left alone for any length of time at my house. They do not hang around very long at all. These are delicious, absolutely impossible to resist.  They never made it to the party they were intended for. I had to buy more. Good Price for an excellent treat. My family loves malted milk balls and gave everyone a carton for xmas how can you not love whopper? yum yum yum How do you not like whoopers. This was a great gag gift for a friend at Christmas that loves them. I was happy to find for a reasonable price and quantity, Been at least 10 years since I had these. Same great chocolate coating. They have removed some of the malt flavoring from the crunchy center. Good thing about that is, I will not be getting a sore tongue now if I happen to binge on these.\n",
      "Arrived in great shape.\n",
      "Best Used By date is 9/2015. as described. Easy to bake with. good buy on subscribe and save, always arrives as expected used for gift bags for my Sunday school kids at Easter.  Well received, of course.  Will buy again for sure. Love these whoppers originals, and it is so convenient to just go get another carton, when I empty one!  This is a favorite for the grandkids too. Arrived in very good condition, though freshness could be a little better. I like to mix these with cashews and almonds for a snack. I loved these as a kid and it is nice to see that they are still easily available to buy in stores or on the web. I do not often buy these but their malted milk chocolate flavor tastes similar to what I recall from my youth.\n",

      "I bought this directly from Amazon and it was packed well for shipping. The outer box was from Amazon and the inner sealed box contained the 12 cartons of Whoppers and had a date on the outside which I assume is the Sell By date or Expiration date. It is 9 months away and the candy tastes fine. These balls are great tasting candy. The aftertaste is great as well. These chocolate balls are tasting. Fully recommended. Five stars. I bought the Whoppers hoping to have them packaged in a container like the one pictured (like a milk carton),  They arrived in about a gazillion individually packed tiny bags.  (A pain in the A** to open.)  The whoppers themselves, however, where just like the ones I had as a kid.  Pretty dang good. Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I do not have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at the negative reviews, they are mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they are vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper. STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE. We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church.  We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes.  I like how easy they are to use.  No mess, no tamping.  I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily. Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredibledark, rich roasts.  FYIthe pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you are going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase. This is the dirtiest rock salt I have ever seen. Remember years ago when you opened up the rock salt, and it was white, and you could actually grab a piece and suck on it ..this is not it !  This bag of salt looked like they would swept it up off the busy New York streets after a long storm\n",
      "and then dried and bagged it. Like a friend said, \"Buy Morton, it is clean salt.\"  Think I will do that next time. It is rock salt Made plenty of icecream What can one say about a bag of rock salt except to ask, (where is the home made ice cream?) Bought this salt along with an ice cream freezer and it worked just as expected. No problems. This is the first time that I have ever found real rocks in my rock salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take my ice cream ball to a friend's house so that our kids can play, and then we can have ice cream.  All goes well until I dump the salty water into her beautiful sink, and then I spend the next ten minutes apologizing and scraping little rocks and what looks suspiciously like bits of glass out of her garbage disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salt part all dissolved right on cue, but that stuff was certainly not all salt. I could not believe that I was right, but when I got home I checked and double checked the bag--yep, little rocks.  Maybe I got a bad bag?  Maybe it is supposed to be rocks and salt instead of rock salt?  All I know is I will be picking a different brand next time I make ice cream. I really enjoyed this bar. It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed.  The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all.  Infact, I barely noticed it.  The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy.  I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat.  I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone. If you are looking for a flavorful treat to provide energy for a hectic lifestyle, the Berry Blast PowerBar Fruit Smoothie fits the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hesitant initially to give this one a try, having tasted a variety of other energy bars over the past few years, some good, some dreadful. I liked the sounds of this one and the fact it is made from real fruit with no additional sweeteners or artificial colors and flavors. So I decided to try it. I am glad I did. While I do not see this becoming a regular staple in my daily diet, it is great for the occasional pick-me-up when I am lagging on energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me. The texture takes some getting used to however. I was not quite sure what to expect so the taffy-like consistency was a surprise. Actually, that made it even better for me. I felt like I was indulging in a rare treat but without the guilt. I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did.\n",
      "\n",
      " Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2008. All rights reserved. I have always been a PowerBar fan. This the best I have ever had!! It has a very fruity flavor and was chewy, in a pleasing sort of way. It worked quite well as appetite suppressant. School is still out on it is \"energizing\" powers. The taste was great. Tasting and Texture Notes for Banana Flavor Power Bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.\n",

      "\n",
      "With a relatively low fat content (see above), nine grams of protein, and above average taste and texture, this is one of the better \"energy bars\" sold. Of course, for specific information about whether this meets your dietary needs, consult a physician, dietician, and/or nutritionist. This is a great quality product and Amazon often saves me on the price. The original PowerBar in Chocolate has been a staple snack in my cupboards for over 20 years. I am not an athlete, but enjoy a whole bar as an occasional meal replacement, or half a bar to push through the afternoon work day. With a large glass of water, they fill me up for hours and boost my energy level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste and consistentsy remind me of the Astronaut Sticks from the late 60s I enjoyed as a kid. (I admit, it is a weird 'comfort' food.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For newbies: the original PowerBar in Chocolate is chewy like a fresh tootsie roll, but not sweet, and definitely more filling. For those who love chocolate, but want to cut back on cane sugar, this is a great alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was part of a Pantry order, and the package arrived intact and fresh. excellent Son who is a collegiate runner loves them and with Prime I am able to ship direct to his dorm. Wonderful! thank you Will buy again Delicious and effective!\n",
      "\n",
      "Use these as a snack every time I am on the trail! Banana is terrible. You can taste the crushed up vitamins and minerals more than the banana flavor. Wild Berry is delicious, the 2 stars are only for the banana. thanks These are the original style of the powerbars.  For some reason not many retailers stock this brand.  Tasty, filling and affordable.  Great for a lunch or snack on the run or when traveling.  When you buy them in bulk they are much less than in the store, when, as I said above, you can find them. as described quick ship. everything else asidethese are difficult to eat.  really not tasty and need something to wash it down.  do fill me up when i do not have a chance to eat properly though.  probably skip these in the future Really has a high level of sugar content -- actually causes a sugar high, then a downer. I use these for the movies.  I cannot find them in the stores any more. Great tasting like candy but much better for you. These actually taste good. I was surprised. These are so tasty. What a great bargain! I am not crazy about this chocolate flavor, but I highly recommend the peanut butter. These are delicious and definitely one of the better all-around tasting protein bars I Have had in a long time. Will be getting more soon. I keep power bars around for when I need a quick meal.\n",
      "I know some people do not like this taste, but I do.  I have it on auto order and always keep a box in the house. <div id=\"video-block-REIHCKGDVUMKD\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C10HmF5a4XS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91-C6xclN-S.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;I have been using the Powerbar Performance Energy bars for years. Great product and love this flavor! I highly recommend! My favorite flavor for a meal on the go.  I use these for a boost between meals and the vitamins in them are great. These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they are not something I can eat very quickly, they are too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars do not have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish. Good try, but these taste too much like over-sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi-acrid aftertaste.  The Chocolates are the best, hands down.  This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added.  Very fake.  They are edible, but they are overpoweringly chemical. The only thing that taste better than the wild berry energy bars are the tropical tangy bars. This is a great PowerBar series. It is a shame that all the nutritional benefits of this bar went to waste on me because I could not even stomach the darn thing. It is literally just  a block of chewy mush with the sharpness of dark chocolate. There were even some random chunks of who knows what stuck in there. I have tried the creamy citrus flavor as well, and that I could at least get down. I am a lover of fruits. I enjoy preparing my own fruit shakes especially during the summer season. I am lucky because I have several relatives in the US which sends over a couple of the foods that they eat there, one of which is Power Bar Fruit Smoothie. They may have remembered me while they were enjoying this during their regular gym work-out. Thanks everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, its time for me to place my verdict. The taste is absolutely yummy. I can eat a dozen of these while watching my favorite television show but in terms of its energy boosting effects, I have to rethink again. It must be due to the sugar included in its ingredients but I did not feel any boosting effect at all. Unlike what my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements does for me. I am one of the few fortunate ones who is suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I sleep long hours yet feel tired and eat more yet feel hungry. It is a complicated condition but with my Gene Eden Vir 101 I manage to perform my daily tasks with ease. I could feel it effectively suppressing the growth of chronic viruses in my body thus giving me the added push to go on with may daily activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I took into consideration the taste and the price offered by the manufacturers and will still consider it a very great tasting snack. But for athletes, maybe they can find other power products that can stand true to its claim. This is not really a PowerBar in the typical sense.  It is more of a thick smoothie-like fruit leather, if you can picture it.  It is all one consistency, meaning there is no coating, no filling.  Tastes like a smoothie but with a rubbery texture, so not that great, especially for an energy bar.  Does not seem filling enough to be 230 calories. I suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. I really do not know how I got this illness but I soon experience extreme exhaustion and weariness from work very often so I ended up asking the opinion of my physician. He informed me that I have active virus which eats up most of my energy so I end up tired and confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system. I am recovering fairly well after taking Gene Eden as my regular supplement but I wanted to perform the previous activities I enjoyed doing like regular gym work-outs and long walks in the park. Ever since I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome I was limited by my doctor to do strenous activities but with the aid of Gene Eden I feel long lasting boosting energy flowing through my blood stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to combine Power Bar with one of my walks in the park and I was amazed how it kept my energy level high. I believe the electrolytes contained in these energy bar is sufficient to keep the cells of my body going.\n",
      "\n",
      "I plan to do an hour of aerobic routine next week and is optimistic that both Power Bar and Gene Eden will not fail me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much for giving me a chance to live my previous life once again. I just hope eating much of Power bar will not make me fat in any way. These particular power bars are very hard to find in my area of the country.  I like the flavor of these power bars over the  many kinds of power bars that contain mainly chocolate. You need a magic tonic to help you recover following a new personal best?  Good luck funding one.\n",
      "\n",
      "You want a candy bar?  Keep looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you want a well-packaged, carb-rich bar that will not melt in your hands, that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45-60 minutes, then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonfat chocolate milk might work just as well, but it certainly will not last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack's side pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Know what you are getting, and use it appropriately.  Then you will not be disappointed! I have always liked power bars even when they did NOT taste so good.  I would take them on the trail with me while hiking or when riding my bike.  They are compact and packed full of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that Power Bar has gotten better and better at improving the flavor and texture of their bars!\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this one.  You will not be disappointed. I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I am giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted \"like vitamins\", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you are prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I would suggest you steer clear of this energy bar. I expected this to have a sweet, smooth taste, like the fruit blend drink. Instead I found a sharp, not quite unpleasant aftertaste as the dominating flavor.  This was not something I would choose. The flavor was not very good, the texture was a little too grainy, and the aftertaste just bordering on bad.  For people who crave smoothies, this is no substitute. This is basically a hunk of quick carbs with some electrolytes and other additives.  It WAS tasty, but does it really do anyting more for you than an ordinary candy-bar? I am not convinced on that one. This bar may well provide a bit of quick energy, but I found the taste achingly sweet. Too bad, because if it were a bit more tart and a lot less sweet,  it might be quite pleasant. This bar was a pleasant surprise.  The flavor was subtle and the taffy consistancy was a surprise but overall tasty! First off this bar is much moister than PowerBar's that I have tried in the past; so much so, that when I held vertical, it would bend one way or the other until the top when past horizontal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But moisture alone does not make a good energy bar. The Fruit Smoothie PowerBar is not bad per se, but it is not very good. It is sweet, but it does not really taste much like a fruit smoothie, especially not a smoothie from the likes of Jamba Juice. It is just kind of of sweet and pliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend one try the Odwalla bars instead, they are much better tasting and they are like eating food, not something out of Soylent Green. I did not get up and sprint around the blocl after I ate this bar so I am not sure as to how much energy it actually provided but it hate a good fruity taste and was about the right size for a quick snack. The bar was quite chewy but that did not distract from it is enjoyment. Would certainly try this product again. Power Bar Fruit Smoothie, Berry Blast\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the flavor of this bar, but, the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein. If it had less sugar and more protein, I would recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gunner  June, 2008 Power bars in general are very soft and chewy. They are not my favorite, but they are not bad. This one has a strong fruity flavor, similiar to taffy. The \"vitamin flavor\" is noticeable, but not horrendously strong. This is a good choice for an occasional snack on the go. Power bars keep well in the car and if they get too mushy due to heat, they recover well when cool again. It is surprisingly very tasty, but I recommend eating only half at a time.  It is pretty good out of the fridge and once it has thawed just a little.  If you eat the whole bar in one setting, it is a bit much with the fruity flavor.  But half of it?  Excellent! First immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it is kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts are not that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they are still quite expensive per single bar. As an athlete, I have used Power Bar products for years.  I have to say this is one of the better tasting Bars.  Has a definite strawberry flavor, without being too sweet.  If you have not ever had a Power Bar, then you may be surprised at the texture.  These are not candy bars!  They provide a great energy boost when you do not have time for a full meal.  Excellent for slipping in your bike jersey pocket for eating on the road.  Highly recommended. Me, I am generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I do not look at them as \"power bars,\" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.\n",
      "\n",
      "PowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (\"Berry Blast\" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a \"fruity gum\" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it was not unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This did not make it the cleanest snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this \"fruit smoothie\" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating\" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie is not going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "FOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It is not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it is an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.\n",
      "\n",
      " Just throw some in your gym bag.  You are good to go! I found this bar to be labeled wrong. It should of been SuperSweet Fruit Smoothy. 24g sugar, 42g carb and only 6g protein. The smoothy I make in my blender is quick and healthy using a protein mix with fresh or frozen fruit. Cannot see myself ever purchasing this. Did not like the candy taste and with such little protein, is not a healthy on the go bar. There are many healthier bar choices for a quick energizing snack. Thumbs down. This was a pretty good energy bar.  The taste was good.  I did notice a energy boost and it was not too high in sugars etc.  Overall, a pretty good product. I tried this Powerbar with another person.  We both were not pleased with the taste.  We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste, we did not think we would ever want another One!  I do not think we are going to finish this bar.  Not the best I have ever tasted and I would never buy this again! A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go who always has time for a sit down breakfast?  Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD ! It was not too bad, but was just too sweet for my wife's taste (I ended up not being able to try it, because it turned out to not be gluten freewhich I need). Work great for bath bombs. Shiploed fast. Great quality. As described cup cake fun time for the grand kids Price WAY too high for what you get, and due to static cling, cannot even get them all out, over half stick to the inside of the already ridiculously TINY little compartment! Great assortment and very fun for kids to use when decorating cookies or cupcakes. my daughter loves candy she would go crazy eating every candy and flavors she see it great for decorating. great thanks Bright and colorful. Hard to get out of container. The non-pareils were static clinging to the inside walls of the container. Kids love them ! Do not get excited by these! The section of the container that holds the sprinkles is only about one inch high!  You will not get many uses out of this if you are preparing a lot of cupcakes! Kids loved decorating with these. Great colors These are really cute sprinkles.  Will be cute on whatever you put them on. Expire? Mine's even better: no expiration or manufactured date! And the taste is horrible, almost starchy. They are cute alright but I will be returning them. Lots of average okay colors mixed in okay shapes that were okay to use for what they were intended. Nice, handy and very colorful. We sprinkle just a few on our cupcakes. Always adds that special touch. Will keep on hand. Nice not to have to fool with six different containers. Little lids open easily and close securely. Good product. Maybe just a tad bit overpriced. Yum I had to buy another of these. I let my grand kids use them for their mud pies. Perfect for kids to decorate cupcakes etc. I bought these for my granddaughter who loves to bake.  She was very pleased. I have a huge collection of sprinkles.  I wanted to use some today and was surprised to find I had not even opened this particular assortment (the animals and stars one, since there are multiple items on the same page), so of course these were the ones I had to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think these are really cute.  I used the stars on some chocolate cupcakes today but am now trying really hard to think of something to do with the cows.  The picture on the item page is an accurate reflection of what you will get and is also fairly reflective of the size.\n",
      "\n",
      "These taste vaguely sugary and have a lot of artificial colors in them.  I figure, you are only using a small amount on any one baked item, so it will not hurt me to consume small quantities.  My experience is that, if you plan to store your baked goods for more than a couple of days, the color does start to bleed out (while I had not opened this assortment, I had a different Wilton assortment with similar ingredients that I would experienced this with), especially with light-colored frostings.  (I always make my own frosting with butter, powdered sugar, and milk.  I cannot say for sure that the bleeding color would happen in canned frosting.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These do not necessarily distribute evenly because the shapes are rather large and tend to clog up the holes in the shaker.  If this happens, just turn the shaker right side up again and bang it on the counter and you should be good to go.  On one batch of 12 cupcakes, I used about 1/3 of the stars.  So you should be able to get at least a couple of uses out of each shape, making these well worth the cost. Excellent! I ordered this product and came to me like the picture and details said about this product. It has 6 different variety of sprinkles. The price was fair for this and mine was not expired like the other said. I feel bad for them because that was unfair for them. I hope your order comes out good when you order this but if you are precautious person then do not buy it. Go to the store and buy it for yourself. It is your choice. The taste was okay to be honest. Most all Wilton sprinkles are okay; they are not the best taste. How can anyone complain about sprinkles?  This variety pack was a little on the small side, but came with a lot of cute colors and shapes. These just make frosted cupcakes look so darn yummy! Cannot wait to mix up a batch and add the sprinkles. I liked the shapes that are included, so was as expected. It was a bit smaller than the other 6 sprinkle mixes that I have purchased locally. I have not had a chance to use these yet but I love the bold bright colors. Container was larger than I expected. Sprinkles for all occasions. Granddaughters enjoy using these on their cake pops. Nice assortment of sprinkles for various baking needs. Got these for my first try at Momofuku's birthday cakeSuccess!  I was really pleased at how colorful they were and how well they were incorporated into the final baked cake.  Will buy again! The packaging was good and arrival time was earlier than expected.  The colors are bright and fun and the sprinkles were fresh and not stale like some can be.  They made my Christmas cookies extra special. I bought these for making pop cakes, but the product is so versatile for color themes and various holidays to decorate cake batters, cookies and dough or if you are really messy, for making pictures on a slice of toast. LOL. Such a minute amount--not worth the money. And, the opening is a nuisance--needs an option to pour,too. Horrible for cake pops! Icing is dry before you can shake them on pop. Perfect Sprinkle Assortment for the price & it comes in a nice little shaker. I am pleased with this product & will order this exact assortment or a similar item again. I ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter.  What I got was a GARISH collection of these that were FAR TOO UGLY to use on anything.  I do not recommend these to anyone. They do not match up to the picture shown.  Shame on Wilton for even making what they sent me. I bought these sprinkles for my wife as a stocking stuffer gift! Great idea by the way, fit wonderfully in her stocking. She tends to be a sprinkle nut and really enjoys sprinkles on cakes and cookies, and cannot get enough! Anyway this set is great, and comes in a soup can sized container with all 6 types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for 4 stars, is because this is a great product, but in the shipping process some of the sprinkles were broken. If you are ok with losing a few in the shipping process, it is definitely something to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this for a kids party or a sprinkles nut like my wife! very convenient and practical to have all those sprinkle in one place, it when on easy and that we like when you are cooking with kids Not too much you can say about this.  A fun pack of sprinkles for the children to make their cupcakes and muffins. Color is very weak.  Does not really help Wilton Candy melts color which are already dim.  Will not buy again. Stains your skin really bad! The colors are not accurate. I did not get patriotic red and blue, I got a funny shade of pink and teal blue. It also is just a jar and not a dropper so it is extremely messy. The jars are pretty little. Not a fan of these at all! I needed something that would allow me to dye mineral oil without having the color separate out, and this works very well.  Do not make the mistake I made the first timeI used too much, and that results in a cloudy color.  Just start with a drop, and take it from there.  With the primary colors, you can make almost any other color you need.  It comes with Blue, Red, Orange & Yellowbut you can make Green and Purple as well by mixing. Red did not mix well to make hard candies, disappointed Works really well with chocolate, hoping they can come out with more colors. Very nice, used these in conditioner to make a natural toner. Worked perfectly Worked for us. Exactly what I wanted As expected. I used this to color mineral oil for sensory bottles. Worked great! This project is PERFECT for coloring melted chocolate because it is NOT water based.  I want more colors !  Great product! These are much better than the colors they sell in the grocery store.  More vivd I am 100% against serving anything with candy melts between the flavor (ick!) and the palm kernel oil so I bought this hoping to color white chocolate for a project. It works, sort of, but it took so much of the product to get a decent color that my chocolate was too soft to set in the molds. I made three separate attempts just to make sure I had not overheated my chocolate or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this product is better suited for candy melts and at that point, you might as well buy the pre-colored variety rather than having to dye them yourself. I did end up using some of this in a buttercream frosting when I ran out of my normal gel color and it seemed ok for that too. Colored my white chocolate perfectly. I used it to make cake pops These work for coloring white chocolate but you need a lot of it to color things vibrantly. I love using these colors to dye my white candy melts! It works really well with the merckens brand that I use to make my cakepops. My only issue with it is that it does not have a drip top. I poked two little holes in the foil, one for the dye to drop out of and one for air to come in for air flow. That way, I do not have to take the foil off completely, which because a mess. We used this to dye oils for a science and toddler projects.  So far we have only used it with baby oil, mineral oil, etc.  But we intend to dye other oil-based substances to make a rainbow in a bottle real soon = )\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that where the water-based and oil-based substances meetthere is a yellow line forming against the plastic bottles. in other words, the dye appears to be staining the bottle itself or precipitating out of solution? I tried to use these to change the color of white chocolate. I did not think about mixing the black with the white chocolate. I wanted black chocolate since I could not find any color melts but obviously white & black mixed makes grey. There was no amount I could add that would create black which was disappointing but understandable. Just wanted to put that out there for anyone else who was not thinking about that like I was. The other colors paired beautifully & the chocolate still tasted the same to me. 1. The caps are not very secure and I have had a mess in my dye box a couple times due to not screwing them on as tightly as possible. Learn from my mistake, otherwise you will have a HUGE mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Give me more dye!! Why do these little containers have to be so stinkin' small? I can use almost an entire color for one single order.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Make this into a squeeze bottle or some kind of dropper! It would be 10x more convenient. Used these as oil dye for oil lamps.  Pretty colors.  Does not take too much dye to color a candle. thank you The amount you get is very small. Works OK. Love this product. Waiting for a long time, but the goods is very satisfied. I think I will buy again. works well I have used this twice for my hard tack candy and it does not \"dispurse\". It does NOT blend at all in the boiling state. Hopefully will work when melting chocolate. Good. Ok Product seemed like it was maybe old, been sitting on a shelf too long the 1st box I was sent was partially open and leaked all over. It appeared that the foam seals were opened and the lids were not on tight- what a mess.\n",
      "But Amazon sent me a new box and they are perfect! they color my white chocolate without making it seize. the colors are lighted then you might want- the red is hot pink. But I was coloring white chocolate so it makes sense. I have never gotten true colors from dye, if I need red, black or brown I just buy candy melts.\n",
      "They mixed ok. I was trying to get purple and it turned out a little gray, and green was dull. So I guess I better buy those color dyes and not try to mix. . Thanks I HATE the Wilton colored chocolate (sorry Wilton).  I use these colors in Merckens and the colors come out vibrant, and with the high quality of the Merckens wafers, the colors are evenly mixed in the chocolate. This is exactly what you can purchase in a store. It cost a little more but being that the store I would purchase this from {crafts 2000\n",
      "} was always out I had no choice but purchase here. This is good option for people needing to use a lot of color. Did not blend into the hard candy mix as it should have.  I am new to making candy, so it might have been my fault.  But I made 4 or 5 batches and had same problem.  I switched to Ateco and I am happier. These colors are bold and bright!  They are very high quality and work very well when making hard candy! I would recommend these. Love this product I was having so much trouble with my chocolate freezing up when I would try to color it for decoration.  This product works great the colors are really clear and not muddled. I use these with my melting chocolate and they work great!! All 4 colors were as described. I did not have problems with colors spilling like another reviewer did. This is a pretty good product i got them about a week ago and already i have to order more. My only problem with this product is it is size. I wish they made them bigger. It actually saves me from having to buy chocolate melts in every color i can just buy white and use the candy color. My mom used this frosting on my sisters wedding cake and I thought it was amazingeven better than the icing on my pastry chef made wedding cake!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised to see bad reviews for this frosting because I love it so much that I changed my own frosting recipe to mimic it. It is a heavier frosting, but lighter (weight/sweetness-wise, I have no idea if it has less or more calories) than pure buttercream frosting feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed the bad reviews and had to redeem this frosting. I really liked this frosting and quite a few people at my sisters wedding did as well. This is not like regular canned icing. It is made for decorating with a bag and tips. It is a lot stiffer and hard to apply if you are planning on using it as a spread icing. Tasted good but tore up the cake a little. There are better tasting products on the market but this white icing is okay. Tastes better on something than straight out of the can. It is stiff so it is good for making flowers etc. but can easily be made more spreadable by just stirring in a little water. great Way overpriced on Amazon!  I bought the same container at Walmart for $2.74!  Anyway, I bought this for a \"mommy and me\" cupcake decorating class.  I do not know why anyone would recommend this icing except for last minute ease of use if you did not have time make your own.  It is super sweet and ridiculously stiff, which serves its purpose if that is what your looking for.  However, many of the Wilson tips (a large range of sizes) that we used in class were too small to properly push the icing out without tremendous force.  I had difficulty.  It was impossible for my eight year old.  The icing seemed suited only for the 2 largest tips.  My classmates were inquiring about a more \"workable\" icing than this.  We were told to Youtube it since better icing exists.  I guess for something quick and cheap (if purchased elsewhere), it was ok.  For 10 bucks, no way!! i am amazed how great this tastes. we bought it to go with the wilton colors Mice I love this product.  It is always consistently good and so convenient.  Stir it up before you use it.  It is easy to use! This came in a plastic tube and made me sick to my stomach. It tastes so bad i threw it out immediately, and then threw up. Amazon sucks for selling this crap. This icing is not meant for spreading over a whole cake. It is very stiff icing for making flowers and other decorations. The icing that comes in the 4.5lb tub is for covering the cake. I recommend not buying from Amazon though. The same product is half that price at WalMart. They put it back with the wedding stuff and crafts. You can also get it cheaper at Hobby Lobby, Michael's, etc. The dark chocolate ones surpass all other flavors we have tried.  They are decadently delicious.  You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price, given that shipping is free with Prime membership.  What a great deal! It was OK, was expecting a milder flavor. These are NOT sweet at all, which I like. These are a great way to eat Dr. recommended dark chocolate.  The wafer is light, crisp and let us the chocolate flavor shine. And they stay fresh and whole in the tins. :) great good value Excellent Piroulines arrived when promised and, as yet,  I have not encountered any broken ones. Each rolled wafer is a perfect combination of textures: you encounter a crisp but not crumbly sheath of dough filled with creamy hazelnut chocolate. Piroulines are a perfect go-with any after dinner service: sorbets, ice creams, berries, gelato. Of all the flavors offered by Pirouline, this Dark Chocolate is my all-time favorite.  Not too sweet, crispy exterior with a fudgy interior -- really nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Like others, my shipment of six 14-oz canisters arrived with some breakage and crumbling.  So far, I have used 4 of the 6 cans, each containing 2 foil-wrapped sleeves (so I have opened 8 sleeves so far).  I have had 3 sleeves with NO breakage at all -- every one completely intact with just a tiny bit of crumbling on an end here and there.  The other 5 sleeves contained some broken cookies -- ranging from 20% to probably 60% of the contents.  Since I purchased these for my own use, this is not a problem.  The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones. :-)  So far, I have had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents.  But if you are looking for perfect presentation, bear in mind that you are probably going to have to deal with some breakage.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I will purchase these again.  The price is comparable to my local supermarket, and having it delivered is a convenience I am willing to pay a bit extra for.  The dark chocolate flavor is divine -- definitely 5-star worthy in my book. I love these things even though I am not really hooked on sweet stuff. I read some reviews on how a lot of the contents were broken up during shipment. Even though, in my caseit was not really a big deal, mine were the same as most.about 40% broken in each can I have opened so-far. Just using these personally, not for show, so.it is really not an issue for me. Other than that, they are good for when you do get the yearning for something sweet. too crumbly These are AMAZING!!! Rich dark chocolate, thin wafer crust. I just love them and so does the wife. Almost an addiction by now :). Belongs in my yummy field. Note that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are complaints about sellers and shippers.  These delicious Belgian cookies are baked in Mississippi by DeBeukelaer, a company which traces its roots to 1860.  They are light, crisp, delicate and made with quality ingredients.  The dark chocolate are my favorite and the one I recommend to chocoholics. Delicious, however many were broken in transit so I did not give them as gifts. I will manage to eat them myself. Yum !! What is not to love? Dark chocolate + easy and fun to eat! (I sometimes pretend to hold them like cigars.) These are available in sealed tins in different sizes.  They are sometimes available in stores, but the Amazon price, per ounce, is somewhat lower than what I have found in stores.  The ones I have purchased have internal foil wraps for added protection.  They can be somewhat fragile if mishandled (that may depend on your local shipper).  They are suitable for serving with coffee or tea for various social events.  The tines have a best buy date shown on the bottom of the tin. Everyone loves these wafers. My sister-in-law introduced me to these wafers and I was hooked immediately, enough that I continue to keep them on hand (thanks to Amazon's subscribe and save). A couple of these will satisfy your sweet tooth. The hard part is trying not to eat the whole can!\n",
      "Love the texture and taste. Great product. I ordered the case and when I opened the first can they were all broken up, I thought maybe it was just that can, but no they were all broken into small pieces, I mean every can into small pieces. I cancelled My subscription, I was so disappointed. The entire batch of wafers were beat up, even the tins! More crumbs and pieces than expected whole wafers. The shipping & packaging boxes themselves were in pristine condition. I am believing these were packed as seconds for sale at reduced prices. I like to reuse tins to store odds & ends and the lids were not fitting due to bashed tins & lids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchase locally and save yourself the disappointment! I used to have these as a kid they do not taste the same at all. Quite terrible to be honest and now i am stuck with 6!!! Eww. i love that they are dark chocolate! i found these once in a fresh market store but not since then. but i was gladdened to find them online. i have one with breakfast every day and oddly they seem to cut down on my overall craving for other chocolate. which is helpful. : > The DeBeukelaer family has been making Belgium biscuits in The United States since 1860.\n",

      "Pirouline is the only national brand of rolled wafers actually made in America. One bite and you will understand why these delicious and light snacks can be very addicting.\n",

      "The biscuit layer is light and flaky and the hazelnut chocolate inside makes for delicious snacking.\n",

      "They come in a tall, slender, 3.25 ounce tin and the tins are great for storing pasta or writing instruments afterwords. Highly recommended. I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines. They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated. They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale. Sorry. The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT!! so, I do not know what happened. I will try again when they have more. Accurately describedgood valuefast shippingWEAK paper wall sugar canisterscanister not as durable as the OLD DIXIE sugar canistersif you use lots of sugar, you will use up the sugar before the container falls apart. It is sugar, what can I say?! One of the three cannisters came broken so all of the contents were rendered useless. Good product, the sugar hardens quick one the package is opened. loved it It tastes great! We had a problem with rough handling during shipping (I guess) and several broke.  But it was quickly resolved by the supplier and I am happy.  I also like the giant container which comes with a pump and can sit on the counter. I eventually decided to purchase the nestle French vanilla twenty four single serving quantity pack (24 3/8 oz or 11 ml creamers totaling 9 ounces)after seeing it enough times at the cereal section of my job. The French vanilla creamers  have a delectable taste and go perfectly with the swiss miss milk chocolate hot cocoa and the nestle rich milk chocolate cocoas. Amazon, would you please change this stupid word count requirement to leave reviews? IT IS CREAMERit was good. I am a't come up with a paragraph about creamer! I shop Amazon a LOT, but rarely leave a review, because of this requirement. Ok,nonsense now, so I will have enough words:\n",
      " Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada To me this is just a plain, old creamer.  I would prefer something with a little spunk in it. So perfect and easy at the office! Guess I forgot about  the 'non-dairy' creamer definition.  my mistakeI have to be careful in the future. Not sweet enough. I have to use three (75 calories) to get the sweetness I like in my coffee. I have opted for another sweeter brand so I can use fewer units to save on calories and plastic waste. This was my second time ordering these. Definitely worth buying. Great taste and great price. This box had some spilled in it, but I was refunded and I plan to purchase again. great great good Little pricy since so small you nees 3-4 per cup, or at least i do These creamers are ideal to have in an office for coffee first thing in the morning. The box is perforated and sturdy so it is easy to open and the creamers come out without a hassle. The plastic  covers on the creamers pull off with little difficulty.\n",
      "I highly recommend these creamers for the office and those who like French Vanilla flavor and are lactose intolerant. Great taste and arrived without any damage whatsoever. I love these creamers! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge (not necessary but I do) and just take out what you need. The price is the best here on Amazon, I first purchased these from another site and paid $2.00 more! I will be back for more. Cannot make the coffee strong enough. I am sure it is good if you like mellow coffee, but I am Cajun and grew up on very strong coffee. Will not buy this again. I first had this coffee while visiting The Netherlands and was elated to find it here on Amazon! This was a good coffee with pretty good natural sweetness and good body,  you could barely taste the bit of the astringency (like coffee here in the states seem to have).  Tasty enough to drink black (no sugar nor creamer needed). It also does not have that \"oily\" residue that other coffee has. Nice overall flavor! Very expensive for what you getbut it was good. Best of the Douse Egberts Tasted terrible. My number one coffee Good coffee Nothing to write home about. Expensive, and not as good as 8 Of the clock Columbian that is 1/4 the price. I would not buy this again, and sorry I bought it this time. Not a very good value. Now, I am waiting for my Cool Brew liquid coffee to arrive. liked the first blend I bought better it was a medium roast. good coffee Really good coffee but is costly. This is some of the best coffee I have ever had, and I have had a lot of average, fancy and expensive kinds.  I was in a restaurant and had this coffee, it was so good I asked the waitress if she could fine out what kind it was.  She wrote it down for me and told me they get asked all the time.  It is so smooth and such a delightful flavor.  I love it!!! VERY GOOD Nothing like the restaurant brew I was looking for. Found this at a hospital. Taste great. Good, but a stronger blend would probably be better. I got this for someone who had it at a restaurant and lived it. It is very smooth! I personally like flavored, organic coffee better. A bit disappointing. Though is is good, it does not taste like the coffee that the restaurant serve. Great coffee More of a hassle than K-cups, but the coffee is good. Wished they carried DE in K-cups. Taste is OK, but no aroma. The expiry date is Jan 15, 2015. I ordered this just a few weeks ago, so this is very out of date coffee they are supplying! Will try coffee tomorrow and report further. Very strong coffee but I like the flavor. Need to add cream because it is too strong for me but I do not even mind My wife and I both enjoy the flavor we would been having coffee shipped from Hawaii and found this to be a much better tasting coffee for about the same cost We do not drink anything now but this and it is decaffeinated companion. Great coffee I love the taste of this coffee. It brings back memories of my trips to Europe and Asia. And the price on Amazon is cheaper than most \"high-end\" coffees in my local grocery store. great taste Great flavor.  I tried this coffee based on the high ratings it received and I was not let down.  I will be back again to order more. Thanks Douwe voor de geweldige smaak! I will go with other brands. Not my type of coffee. Just okay My friends had us over and served us this coffee.  I had to come home and order it right away.  It is smooth, great tasting, and I highly recommend it. Great coffee, I brew it in my Bunn coffeemaker.  I think I will have a cup right now. This is the same brand served in one of our nearby casinos, but hard to find.  Good coffee. The best drip coffee I have found.  I have been drinking it for several years now, even while straying off to try other brands.  I keep comming back to this for a smooth cup of morning warmth. I was curious to try this, believe it or not, after seeing this product being served to patrons of a casino which I visited. I love coffee and will try any brand at any time, even though I am fairly loyal to another brand. This was available at a decent price with free prime. Not bad at all even for what I paid. I would likely purchase it again if what I do use ever became unavailable. My husband and I were so disappointed with the flavor of this Aroma Rood blend. We love the Douwe Egderts Pure Gold Coffee. But this we awful and we dumped the whole can into our compost pile. We ate at Cheddars and fell in love with the coffee!very rich, deep, robust flavor.I asked what brandsince  then, I have been trying to find the Douwe Egberts that mimics the coffe we drink at Cheddars.  I have not found it yet!  It was recommended that we try the Columbian D. E.  I have tried that, it is closer but stil no cigar.  This brand is far too expensive to buy for a generic cup of coffee.  I can get that from Folgers which is what my husband thought he was drinking.  I say, save your money.  Although it is good, it is not great. Classic bubble gum flavor with a subtle mix of mint. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two every time. One seems like too small that I almost do not feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.\n",

      "Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of \"Juicy Fruit\". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.\n",
      "It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States. tastes good Tasty, mild, but not long lasting taste Good taste, for about 5 seconds.  After 10, you are just exercising your jaw, tasteless. Great price on orbit chewing gum. I do not know why but I found it difficult to find sweet mint in the store now. Also for denture and partial wearers this does not seem to stick to dental work. Tasty My spouse's favorite gum.  I do not chew it because I do not eat gelatin but he will not chew anything else. I am not a fan of peppermint. It is too strong. Sweet mint has that perfect fresh taste while also having a flavor just sweet enough to actually enjoy chewing it. My husband chews this to curb his sweet addictions Absolute favorite flavor.  Good price here on Amazon too. Pretty good Price Loved this gum but something has changed. Does Not hold its flavor very long anymore. This gum is tasty and a great deal! great deal, arrived quickly Unfortunately, mine was stale as well. However, the taste was OK and it was not too expensive, so I am not too upset, but next time I will buy it at the grocery store. Tasted like rubber, zero mint flavor, broken in particles within 10 minutes of chewing. The only gum I chew.  It is, what it is.  What can you say about gum. I would not survive without this gum.  It satisfies my sweet tooth while keeping me from eating stuff I do not need.  I really enjoy this gum. Great buy While you are chewing it, everything's great. It is fresh, it feels good, and you wish it could go on like that forever. Then it reaches a point where it loses it is appeal completely and you spit it out in disgust, hoping to never, EVER see it again, discarding it like a used up tissue. Love this gum. Great, long-lasting flavor. This is my favorite gum flavor. very tasty. Such a reliably delicious flavor. Order, order, order! Love, love Orbit fruit flavored gum. This is a great value My favorite gum! not too strong but gets the job done and lasts a long time! amazing deal Minty, did its job I found I was buying this at the grocery store frequently and decided it would be more cost effective to buy this large package on Amazon.  Wonderful idea! A favorite flavor Very nice, tastes great Superior mint flavor that lasts a long time. this is good! Grandson love them as expected Great Product! My favorite gum, and this is not a bad price. My daughter and her boyfriend both really like this gum, will not chew anyother AWESOME PRODUCT Great! Only place I have been able to find this flavor. Fresh. No issue Great product! GREAT GUMPLEASED ED Tastes like jello Best flavor. Not too minty and not disgustingly sweet. Love cinnamon gum! Only gum we chew, only buy on Amazon. Great price. Prefer the spearmint. I love Orbit and this is my favorite flavor. I like that you get a ton of gum in this package. I would definitely recommend it. The flavor of this gum is so good that I always buy it from Amazon in bulk!!  I have been buying this from Amazon for the last 3 years and I still love the flavor! Excellent product Great gum, even better value! it is gum, good price. Gum last and gets me through the day. Good flavor for sugar free and low sodium too. My family loves this Spearmint Orbit gum.\n",
      "It lasts a long time even after chewing for a long time it still has flavor.\n",
      "I love that Amazon offers great deals on items that my Family and I use. I took advantage of the $1.00 off coupon and also the reduced price adding this on to an existing order of $25 or more.\n",

      "I purchased this item full price as described above. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way for my thoughts. Exactly as described. Love this stuff. Jaw gets tired before it runs out of flavor. great long lasting flavor. My husband and I go through gum like crazy while trying to avoid eating unhealthy foods and avoid eating out of boredom. This gum is great love this gum Great Price. Fast Shipping. LOVE THIS SUGAR FREE GUM Good purchase I am addicted to this Bubblemint gum! Khan Lee is Awesome. Tastes good and is refreshing just like it supposed to . We love orbit gum and love this car case for it. It is a lot of gum, you all. Bought these in bulk for my girlfriend. Tired of spending more $ at target for them :) My mouth waters just thinking about this flavor! The flavor only lasts a few minutes sadly, but I only really chew gum for something to chew on, and also to make my breath smell great. This gum gives your breath a very powerful strawberry smell, really great. My son loves this stuff. Flavor is great! My kids love knowing mom always has gum available now :) It taste like its suppose to. Not very flavor able The best price you could ever get, Fresh made (not expired or not even close to expiry date), original neat whole pack that you could not buy from stores on this price. Orbit have had the best quality since beginning. Do not hesitate to get advantage of this great price deal of the best Sugar Free Gum. great value for a 24 pack Better than expected. MMMM Tasty Gum great flavor loved the price for this I love this stuff.  I smoke, and this helps promote saliva production to keep my mouth healthy, and my breath fresh. What is there to review/say?  Like broccoli or opera, one either loves or hates it.  I love Orbit gum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got tired of chasing down sales at local stores and just bought it by the case on Amazon.  No regrets. I was expecting a longer flavor experience but it does take care of coffee breath. The bottle was busted & only a couple of pieces were on the bottom of the box.  Must be a trail of gum from here to where ever the gum came from This is a really nice warm minty flavor.  Its Mild Flavor.  Though, some people like a really strong minty flavor that helps people with what they feel may be their own bad halitosis.  LOL!\n",

      "If you found this review helpful.  Please click Yes at the bottom of this review.  Thank You. Tastes and smells great! Sometimes the Strawberry flavor is hard to find but not on Amazon! One of the only flavors I chew. Love them! Does not last as long as I thought it would but it is okay. We have tried all the varieties of Orbit gum but always come back to the Bubblemint Sugarfree in the familiar pink package. It is a traditional flavor; nothing gimmicky, has long-lasting chewiness (I will keep it in for about 30 minutes) and most importantly, does not leave my teeth feeling icky or bitty. Amazon has the best price I have found, and when you use Subscribe & Save it is even cheaper! now I have acquired the cinnamon penchant Tastes Great! I have been sampling a variety of different chewing gums so far, and I would say this is my favorite. Sweet, with a nice texture. Flavor is not terribly long-lasting, but no worse than other gums I have tried. I will definitely buy again. This strawberry flavor tastes very phony and kind of weird. My favorite flavor of Orbit gum is the Tropical Remix. None of these gums' flavors lasts more than about 6-7 minutes at most. Caution: the more pieces you chew the more gas you will pass (I mean severe). And if you chew 2 entire packages within a day, you will probably get diahrrea like I did!!! All of the Orbit gums are bubble gums which I like but the pieces are rather small so I chew 2-3 pieces at a time. Love this gum and in the pantry a good price The flavor is powerful and seems to last! Nobody else makes this flavorhark back to bubblegum of old. Excellent.  Fresh! Good lasting flavor and priced right with Amazon Pantry. Always keep these handy.  sugar free best gum around.  bubble mint rocks. Great product! one of the few cinnamon flavored sugarfree gums that last in flavor for more then a few minutes. I liked the flavor This is a great but on subscribe and save and pmuch cheaper than I can find in the store.  Flavor does not last that long but it is great while it does.  I keep the entire desk on my desk at work and take a pack when I go to meetings and leave on the table for the group.  It is usually gone by the end of the meeting. Best cinnamon gum bar none!! Always fresh-tasting, never disappoints! The flavor is tastes good, but it does not last. Good price and free shipping. This is NOT BUBBLE-GUM\n",
      "This is only flavored like it.\n",
      "YOU CANNOT BLOW BUBBLES with IT, not even one tiny one!!! Omnomnomnomthis is so deliciously tasty I have to refrain from eating more than one piece at a time. Tastes like the old pink bubblegum we used to get with trading cards. no complaints tasted great and lasted a nice amount of time..Worth the purchase.. Fresh! My wife's favorite My entire family likes the Wintermint flavor. Buying it by the case saves money, especially when I purchase through Amazon's subscribe and save program.\n",

      "Orbit gum has a nice long-lasting flavor. I would highly recommend. best gum there is, will buy these forever Sweet and bubble gummy and not overly minty.  I keep a cup in the car all the time and it takes away my craving for sweets and freshens my breath without smelling like mouthwash. Nice flavor This is a great price for gum. I love it makes my mouth dry,flavor is good.will not buy again. Long lasting mint flavor with a touch of bubble gum flavoring.  very unique taste. Great price compared to individual packs.  Handy to keep in the desk drawer without damaging the gum.  Also a plus, it is one of the few gums available that I have not had a problem with it sticking to dental work!  That makes it #1 in my book.  FYIOrbit Watermelon flavor also does not stick to dental work No issues Great flavor! Good wat to buy. I do not only enjoy the flavor but also the price that is offer for. Had ordered more than once. According to my dentist I should chew more gun, especially in between meals when brushing may not be possible. But I did not want a sugary offering; sugar-free is the way to go.  And Orbit from Wrigley, offers up the best price /taste combination. While the flavor does not last nearly as long as I would like (would not we all want it to last and hour or so), I still enjoy the brand and it is plethora of flavor offerings. The gum has an amazing strawberry flavor, but it does not last very long. I ordered two cases and all of the gum was mushy. When I would initially bit into the gum it would crumble apart in my mouth. After about 30 seconds of chewing it would solidify into a piece of gum. After about 30 minutes to an hour of chewing it would turn into a nasty mush in my mouth that I would have to spit out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the gum I got was not stored properly or was old. I cannot recall what the expiration date was on the package, but I remember that it was not past the expiration date. I love Orbit Bubblemint Sugarfree gum. So technically I should give it 5 stars.\n",
      "However, in the 24 packs that I have received from Amazon almost half were bad. They were melted, stuck to the paper, and when we tried to chew they disintegrated. I am not sure if the warehouse that those are in, is too warm or if I just got a bad batch but I will go back and buy them at the store instead of ordering from Amazon. This is a shame since the pricing here would be awesome! I like to have gum on hand.  I especially like it as a dieting tool:  when I have the urge to eat and I am not really hungry, I chew some gum and that usually does the trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orbit is definitely my favorite brand of gum.  I find that each piece keeps its flavor for at least an hour, and it does not get that dried-out, tacky feeling.  I suppose you could say that it stays moist, and does not really lose its texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have chewed minty flavors for years, and then last year I got into the Cinnamon flavor.  All of those are great!  I ended up buying the bubblegum flavor simply because it was much less expensive, and I figured, \"why not?!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really enjoying the flavor.  Bubblegum is not a flavor I have very often.  It is sweet, too, which really satisfies my sugar tooth.  Plus, I like how when I have an open pack, my purse gets a sweet smell!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this was a great purchase.  You get two boxes, each of which has 14 pieces.  So, aside from just the sheer quantity of gum, I like that I have several layers of plastic wrap protecting the packs of gum.  Seriously.  I live in a climate that gets very hot and humid during the summer, and if my gum is not protected, it gets all mushy and loses its flavor.  It gets ruined!  So, given that it will take me a while to use this whole thing, I am very glad that each pack, and each box, is covered in cellophane and will last!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:  I definitely recommend.  Especially with the subscribe & save pricing, you cannot buy good-quality gum at a better price!  And the bubble gum flavor is a sweet little treat that reminds you of when you were a kid. Bubble gum at its finest. Arrived on time, wrapped well, does not expire for a year, so I know it will not get tough and yucky before I go through it.  Good deal for the item, just wish it did not have to be an add on! Great tasting gum and great deal from Amazon. I love this gum. It is so yummy and I can chew it all day long. For some reason, it is becoming more difficult to find this flavor in stores, so this big package is perfect. Plus overall, it is cheaper and more convenient to buy this way. Love this flavor. Can be hard to find in stores sometimes, so much easier to buy a big package. Well worth it. great Remix to what? Similarly to R. Kelly's jam \"Remix to Ignition\"The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original. That being said, I like this gum. It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply. It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wrigleys-Orbit-Bubblemint-14-Count-Pack-of-12/dp/B004DIXSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wrigleys Orbit Bubblemint, 14-Count (Pack of 12)</a>. You cannot win them all. Truth be told, that is a better gum. This is more of a special occasion gum, when you are really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country. I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby. Review over. This is a great deal for the money. BEST. GUM. EVER!\n",

      "I LOVE LOVE LOVE the taste of this gum, especially right after my first cup of coffee at work.  I feel like it cleans my breath and I hope it cleans up some of the coffee stains (not sure it does but I HOPE).  I always have a case of this stored in my desk drawer.  One in my lunch bag, one in my purse and one in my car.  I never go ANYWHERE without it. Lots of gum for a decent price.  I will not run out of gum for a very long time.  It was fresh, not stale and old.  Would buy from again. Best. Gum. Ever! ~N Wonderful Orbit is usually my go-to gum brand, and is also usually a great product, but these pieces are hard and not at all refreshing. kids love it, last a long time This is a nice fun gum.. Seems a little hard to chew at first.. but good for the purpose of easing up on sugar love this gum! and buying in bulk saves me $$ best gum. How could you not love Orbit Bubble Mint chewing gum? It is refreshing, and will keep your breath nice and fresh! Great gum with a flavor that lasts a long while.  I usually prefer mint gums; however, this cinnamon is a great change.  I have bought 3 cases and have not had any problems with it being hard.  Perhaps I do not chew gum for as long as othersI can say that I usually have this gum for about an hour and a half and find that the flavor is still there.  Happy chewing! Hi there, These gums are pretty nice, they release the cinnamon flavour but not for a long time. The taste is less strong compare to the classic Big Red but at least they do not contain ASPARTAME. Overall good product sugarfree Yummy! This is the best sugar free gum on the market besides the wildberry!  Small pieces, great for kids, easy to chew, and very tasty.  I recommend this to anyone who loves sugar free gum. Wellit's cinnamon gum.  It tastes good and the flavor lasts long enough.  We have bought these for years and do not look to change. I really like the cinnamon flavor of the gum, but that is about where the pros end. The gum was hard from the start, and I do not know if this is because it is too old or what. I do not mean like rock hard, but it is just too tough. The flavor lasts for maybe 10-15 minutes or so, so not great on that end either. It is just OK. It tastes good when chewing it but the flavor does not last long enough.  Other brands hold their flavor, this type after you chew it for a few minutes, the flavor vanishes away. Think big red when you order this gum.  Did you grow up chewing big red and remember people or kisses related to it?  If so you will welcome the smell and tingly of this cinnamon gum.  I will probably order this again from amazon sooner than the 6 months I set it to subscribe.  Tasty and when you open the pack the whole car smells warm and cinnamonly After the dentyne fire variety this was dull n does not last as long. Not bad if you cannot stand the stuff that burns Fresh breath, long lasting flavor, does not become rubber hard after 20 minutes of chewing like so many other brands. In fact I can chew on two sticks all day and feel satisfied. I am a bit of an compulsive gum chewer so having stashes all over the house and at work have turned into a trend.  Comes in 2 standard sizes boxes with 12 packs in each box. Always concerned with things like these when buying in bulk that they may be stale.  Everything was perfectly fresh and should keep me happily chewing for the next few months. Got this for my daughter, who lives in Istanbul.  She and  her husband love the cinnamon flavor.  Turkey has\n",
      "sugar free gum, but no cinnamon flavor.  There national brand flavor is very strange, an herb like flavor, that is\n",
      "very unappealing to the American palate. I am a recent convert to gum. My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene. I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It is sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen. It is too early to tell how effective it is in the long term, but my mouth feels cleaner. This flavor looked delicious! And it indeed is when you pop it into your mouth because it is an explosion of fruity, juicy, strawberry (tastes like watermelon thought) goodness. And while you are salivating and chomping it around in your mouth, I am NOT kidding, 20 seconds later, the flavor is sucked dry and your left with a wad of flavorless gum in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like seriously orbit, I know your other mint flavors last more than this! This is one of the gums which I have experienced that loses its flavor almost instantly! Thank god I only bought one pack, and I eat it when I am craving something sweet and fruity and it does its job in the first 20 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not waste your money on a whole 12-pack of this, buy one pack and test the truth! This is a good gum, but in terms of flavor it is not the best for Cinnamon flavor, that honor belongs to Big Red. That said, it is a good buy for the price. my favorite gum. very original bubble gum flavor with a hint of mint. the mint is little not over powering the bubble gum flavor. Like it better than any other gum I tried and  I have tried a lotstarted chewing gum when I quit smokingmy only complaint is it seems to lose it flavor too soon and start tasting terrible guess it is made that way I love the taste of Orbit's Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor lasts, and its good for your teeth; including your dental work. My son and I love Orbit gum. It usually keeps its flavor better than other sugar-free gums. In this case, although the flavor lasts fine, the taste is not what we expected. I am not a big fan of mint gums, but my son usually likes them. He does not like this flavor. The mixture of cinnamon and mint makes for a strange combination and is not one that we will buy again. AFTER CHEWING FOR SOME TIME THE GUM GETS STALE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE IT SHORTLY. OR MAYBE I JUST CHEW TOO FAST LOL NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE THOUGH. IT WAS AN ADD-ON ITEM. You are VERY lucky if you find a gum that does not have its flavor vanish before you have gotten in a bunch of chews.  Orbit cinnamon has a lot of flavor and you can actually sit down while chewing.  With other gums, you do not even reach your chair before you run out of flavor and have to get up to toss it away.  Best of all, it is sugar free -- that is zero calories. Cannot get better than that. The picture was very clear and I liked very much the manufacture also, I received the part on time without any problem. Thanks for the job let us keep working like this satisfying correctly the customer. i was thought it might be a huge size, well, its actually normal. and we like this flavor and this brand. Orbit gum has really had some good flavors, and others that have felt more mixed than divine. When I heard they had done a strawberry gum, I wondered is it was good. Well, it could have been more with Orbit's Strawberry Remix gum. It tastes alright at first, but easily loses it flavor, faster than any gum that I have tasted in awhile. The strawberry flavor does not last long, only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away. I really did not feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy. Instead, I definitely think that Wrigley's should really consider making this flavor stronger to the tee, than this would be a flavor I would recommend for anyone that needs a quick chew on the go.\n",

      "Price: D\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: C\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: C- Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.\n",

Kelly's jam \"Remix to Ignition\"The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original.  That being said, I like this gum.

You cannot win them all.  Truth be told, that is a better gum.  This is more of a special occasion gum, when you are really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country.  I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby.  Review over. Unfortunately this particular box of gums contained staled and hard pieces.\n",
      "Do not know why, since the fruity flavour Orbit gums were great . . . . I like orbit gum and it is vegetarian friendly. This bulk pack gives me an abundance and keeps me from having to buy a Costco membership. Even Walmart does not carry this quantity packaging so it is a good deal. I have ordered a lot of gum off Amazon, many different brands and flavors.  This is my favorite.  I think anywhere you buy gum, sometimes you get a stale pack or batch, but overall I have been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again. I know I chew too much gum, but I really like this gum.\n",

      "1. At over 50 I still blow bubbles\n",
      "2. It has a slight mint flavor\n",
      "3. Still tastes like bubble gum. In my opinion, the Sweetmint Sugarfree Gum is the best flavor made by Orbit.  The taste is wonderfully sweet and flavorful and lasts longer than any other brand of sugar-free gum I have tried.  The fact that it is better for your teeth, being free of sugar, is only icing on the cake! I sent these to our troops in Afghanistan who wanted gum and I am sure they are very pleased. The price is great. Would rather have the whitening gum. Falls apart when chewing I do not like it at all.\n",
      "Love the Harder Pieces Yummy on those! Sugar free, great taste, pretty long lasting.  Not a lot to say about gum.  I like it a lot. Starbucks has a flavor all its own. This is a delicious Espresso blend. Although I have a Keurig and so use coffee pods I  also use my percolator at times especially when on my patio. The Starbucks dark Roast coffee is very good indeed. It is quite a strong blend which is what I enjoy and I hope to buy more when the need arises I like the deepness, though I usually mix 50:50 with something softer (like Dazbog Mocha Java). A little too bold for me to drink cup-after-cup of this straight. Not much to say other than I love Starbucks. Love their coffee and this is a good strong brew. I used it in my Keurig and it works great in the reusable KCup. All in all it is worth the price. This is just was it says it is and really good. Good stuff This espresso is great but I must have read the size wrong because you can get this same size at the grocery store for half of the price. It was my mistake though. have been a user for several years.  starbucks is the best and really not that expensive as I only have a couple cups of joe in the morning.  never thought about the descriptive \"espresso\" as I do not use it for that though some could find it misleading. as for me who likes  it bold and like mud its perfect. YUM!! I bought this coffee when I ran out of my favorite espresso coffee, Goya. It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes, so I figured it might be worth it. First, it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine. Second, it seems to be among the more bitter of any grocery store espresso coffees that I have ever bought. Even with milk and sugar, I could not mask the bitterness. I will not be buying it again. I was looking for a decaf the was a full rich medium roast with a wonderful satisfying flavor. Starbucks failed to deliver. Dunkin Donuts House Decaf is for me the gold standard in this category. This coffee is soooooooo good! I bought it after I started experiencing heartburn from my over consumption of regular coffee. So in the AM, I have a 20 oz. regular, then the 16 oz decaf. If you get heartburn, this is a good choice..I would defy anyone to tell it is decaf. I bought mine @ TJ Maxx @ a steal! Do not know why it was so low priced..possibly due to the May best buy date..I bought in March, or that it was in the old blue print bag? Do not know, but I got one 12oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it. After trying it, went back and bought 3 more bags..wish now, that I would have bought a case. The price was phenominalending up being .50/oz, compared to Starbuck's price of .81/oz and Amazon's price of .74/oz. I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ, but alas, that story's over. Amazon's price is good and this is where I will order going forward, now that I am hooked! We live in NYC and this stuff goes for $14-15 per bag in most stores. Amazon's price (3 for $23) is an amazing discount. Plus, this coffee is excellent. Five stars. There is nothing like Starbucks for a morning pick me up. The very best. An excellent value. Highly recommend the product. Robust full flavor, for the discriminating coffee drinker. Real coffee flavor for a decaf. I highly recommend it, as I do with all Starbucks products. Excellent Great coffee What can you say, it is Starbucks!  I French Press this and the taste is amazing. Love Starbucks, best tasting coffee! good coffee, timely delivery Tastes like an old ashtray. Scorched and garbage-y. Even half and half could not mellow it. I actually threw the rest of the brand new bag in the garbage after making just one small pot. This coffee is strong and slightly bitter. It would probably taste much better if I added milk or sugar to cut down on the bitterness, but I prefer to drink black coffee. With a choice between this or other weak flavored or watery coffees, I would choose this one every time, but there are other brands that have the same strength without the bitterness. great Thanks Great coffee, but high price. Local stores no longer carry the decafe. Very nice indeed. Love this product! Has a very good flavor and aroma.  Makes for a good cup of coffee with or without cream or sugar. Great robust flavor for those who like their coffee strong.  I am hooked on the taste and look forward to it every day.  Even though it is medium blend and decaf it still has the zing to it that makes it popular with many.\n",
      "I plan to buy more when this is gone. This is exactly what I was looking for but couldln't find at more local store. I wouldln't have ordered it if I did not have PRIME, way over-priced. These are nice, they add a little shimmer. works well Did not like this at all. I purchased two bottles of these to use for wedding cupcakes and I am glad I taste tested them before decorating my desserts because it would of turned into one of my worst nightmares. I sprinkled some on a dollop of whipped frosting I made and ate it and it was just terrible. The texture of this is exactly like thin plastic flakes and they do not dissolve easily when eaten. I had to use my front teeth to smash these down while they stuck to my teeth and it just was not an enjoyable experience since it felt like I was eating plastic. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it. Very small jar.  My fault for not realizing it. Clearly this is not for everyone. In my opinion, the sparkles are flavorless once added to frosting, icing and the like. I think it is the texture that is odd. I mean it is odd in the best sense of the word. There is something to be said about the unique texture it gives to your finished goodies. It is snow-like; I would even say glass-like. It especially looks cool when you match the color of sparkles to the color of icing (e.g. pink icing with pink sparkles). I cannot think of anything else on the market comparable to this. I have tried it on flooded icing when making sugar cookies and frosted cupcakes. I think it is worth trying. I like it! Nice I use at least a jar of these every year for the snow on a winter cake, and it is great stuff. Very sparkly, but subtle, and does not add a lot of crunch the was sparkling sugar does. Very pricey online but just as expected These flakes of shimmering sugar candy are fantastic!!!! They give elegance to any cake!  I though them on after cake is finished and looks fantastic!!!!! I always keep them on hand! A little disappointed in this product. This is more clear then sparkle. I wanted to put them on top of pink cupcakes for a wedding shower, but this was barely noticeable. love! Add a little class to the top of cakes!  Recommend using by all means. Must have for adding sparkle to cakes!  The only thing I like better is airbrushing shimmer onto cakes!  But, these sparkles can be sprinkled on cakes, cupcakes, etc. thank you great Love them. Very light and feathery. Beautiful color. Very nice. There is nothing glittery or sparkly about these sprinkles. I ordered the purple and expected the product to look like glitter, not tiny cut up pieces of plastic. It is not what I wanted at all, these should not be advertised as sparkles. Confetti would be better suited. Will never purchase these again. Great for finishing touch! Not too big but enough to give a nice shine like crystals did not use it yet but they are oretty They do shimmer. They are a little expensive for a tiny jar of sprinkles. Okay sprinkles, great seller. Easy to use and lovely to look at on my cake. great product, excellent shipping. have used this product for years and I was very satisfied. I like being able to get what I need. I have never seen edible glitter on a confection before, and the guests at our 5 year old's party were impressed.  Several asked if they could really eat it.  It does not taste like anything, so it is just for looks, but very shiny and cute.  I found them easy to apply, just tap the container lightly, but I do not mind a random effectthey're sprinkles after all, and a little clumping does not look bad at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tried the hearts and stars, which I preferred a bit.  These melted into the frosting a bit after storing in the fridge, but the stars and hearts kept their shape.  This product might best be used as a \"fill\" for stencils. Came quickly and was the deep purple I anticipated. And the best part is was about 1/2 the cost of what was offered in the store. Cake sparkles are intended to give just that; a bit of twinkling color.  If used alone, the impact is subtle.  If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath.  I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies.  After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top.  The icing will hold them in place.  The two layers create a beautiful, richer look.  Think of a precious stone.  Without being cut properly, the stone will not sparkle.  But, with facets and light, it comes to life.  That is what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing.  I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.\n",

      "This is not a product that you can taste.  It is not sweet.  Its purpose is to complement your baked goods, unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles/jimmies.\n",

      "Wilton consistently provides excellent quality supplies and I have been using their products for about 34 years. sparkles are okbut melt into the frosting and do not show up as nicely as they should, container was 1/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself. Great combo.  Works well together.  Tastes great. Love the Zone bars but can only find them on Amazon.com.  Lucky for me. My daughter gave me one of the peanut butter bars, and I loved it. It also filled me up for the next few hours. I ordered them soon after, and both my husband and I think t hey are great! Delicious. My favorite energy bar. Super delicious, and the price was better than the regular grocery store. No complaints.  Good taste, good price, fast delivery. Love these, but I did not realize that there were two different flavors in the box. These are pretty good, but, I am doing Weight Watchers and wanted a marginally nutritious meal replacement bar for when I do not have time. These little boogers are 8 SmartPoints each! They are loaded with sugar and fat! And, they are not that big. No sir. So, I am going to carefully finish these and never buy this again. NEVER! These bars are awesome as a meal replacement (or a snack depending on your hunger!).  These are my two favorite flavors.  Unlike many other protein bars, these do not taste chalky at all.  The flavors are delicious!  I highly recommend trying them.  You will not be disappointed! good Delicious and nutritious Delicious, but way too much sugar. Tasty and filling. yummy Delicious! Great product! One of my favorite flavors! Not my favorite protein bars but not horrible either Great productjust as seller described Taste great I love Zone bars but this box of bars had seen better days.  They are edible but the chocolate coating is splotchy and the bars are on the tough and dry side.  Not a Zone bar issuethe brand is fantastic and I have enjoyed them for yearshoping this was just an isolated box. Good value and good flavors. I love Zone bars! Never want to be without these! Good to have around all the time! Love these!!!!! will order more tomorrow. I already reviewed the item and felt negatively about it. First the bar has 15gr. of sugar and 200 calories and relative a low protein content.  I do not consider it a health bar.  It is of course my fault for assuming that the Zone contains low amount of sugar.  The sugar makes me hungry after an hour. They are great to have in my purse while doing errands. It is what we like! We were introduced to these at Costco and love them.  Great product. Tastes great, filling and lasts with you a long time. My daughter keeps one in her car when she does not have enough time between clients to eat a sit down lunch. I eat them to keep from eating a pint of ice cream as the bars are healthy and very satisfying. So glad we tried these. These were shipped fast! I love the graham taste. Very good bars! Very filling. great for poaching eggs in the micro=wave Not great for baking, you still need to flour the pan afterwards. I currently use it the same way you would use original Pam. Great stuff, better than Pam Great price. We make a lot of cakes in this house. We do not have time to add a cake that breaks to our day. We used to flour and oil our cake pans. But they would break or the side would stick. When I discovered this spray I hoped it would work. It does!!! It is the only spray I will use for my cakes. I just spray the pan and add the cake batter! It makes life so much easier. Do not spray the pan and then let it sit. Spray the pan and then add the batter as soon as possible.  I always keep this spray around. It is a must for perfect cakes. This spray is a time saver. I am so glad I have it on my shelf now! excellent product, wonderful transaction. thanks! works beautifullyespecially for bundt cakes & a lot easier than butter & flour I often bake cakes and after struggling with them sticking to the pan I got this. It was perfect. Now, my cakes and other treats never stick. This is a must buy for anyone who has ever baked in their life! I have never used a non stick spray in a cake pan before.. but recently i purchased two very elaborate bundt cake pans that had lots of tips and points..they are more like a mold than a cake pan.  I decided to try Wiltons spray and see it if worked.  Its certainly easy enough to use.. spray the pan and add your batter and bake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did follow someone is suggestion on releasing the cake which was to take the cake out of the oven and let it sit untouched for ten full minutes then I used a soft spatula to run along the sides between the cake and the pan.. and inverted the cake onto a plate. I tapped the bottom of the pan several times then gently lifted the pan.. and the cake came out perfect.  I made three cakes with three different pans using the same method.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be noted that I sprayed the pans quite liberally with the spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can only base my review on what I experienced.. but it worked well for me both times so I am giving it a thumbs up as it is working well with my bundt cake pans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this review was helpful for you.  I have enclosed a few photos to show the detail on the cake and how it released well from the pan. Its fine. Still have some when we like it. I do not bake without it thanks great I love this product! I use it for all of my baking, frying, whatever needs! I have been using this for years and have yet to have a cake stick. It is flavorless as well. Works great for ALL baked goods. My cakes, bars, brownies, muffins, etc. never ever stick when I use this. I think it works better than flour/butter in the pan. I do love this product.  I do not bake a cake without it. i never use any other spray. leaves no taste that would take away from my food and my cakes come off the pan with ease I could not find this in the stores I love using this because it does not change the taste of the food You can buy it for less in stores such as Joann's and Michael's but it is great for baking and I always make sure I have it in my pantry. These sugar crystals are shiny black  I use them against a white royal icing for terrific contrast.  When used on black royal icing, they make your finished product shimmer with depth.  They really make my cookies pop with a colorful sparkle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip:  If you are decorating cookies, place waxed paper or a paper towel beneath the cookie you are decorating.  When you are done, it makes it much easier to put back into the jar the crystals that never made it onto your cookies.  That saves you money and time. Beautiful color. Perfect on our pumpkin cookies I actually purchased these to make desserts for a high school graduation party since these are the school colors. Came out nice and I did not have to buy 2 different shakers of sprinkles! Just what I needed for my patriotic cupcakes! around Christmas they always run out.  so now I will not run out.  great sugar sprinkles. k Just like the ones in the store. Bright colored sprinkles great for King Cakes! LOVE Wilton sorinkles are the standard in our kitchen. Horrible product. Absolutely NO shimmer. I used these black sugar sprinkles in a dessert and was embarrassed to see that it dyed everyone is mouth greenish black after eating it. I am not talking just a little bit.it was hard to get off and pretty gross. It was also hard to get out of the counter top after cooking with them. The remaining bit of this stuff went in the trash. used them for my chocolate covered pretzel sticks MORE WHITE SPRINKLES THAN SHAMROCK ONES. BUT OK PRODUCT. Needed these I refer these over the grocery brand I used to buy. Much finer and more vibrant. Recommended. Also, arrived in ample time for Xmas baking despite my ordering them at the last minute. I am a fan of Wilton products.  Rarely do I ever get something that is lacking in quality.  I picked up the \"Cinnamon Drops\" to use as noses for my reindeer cake pops.  They worked great, looked great and taste great!  Definitely would purchase these again.

Black can appear in many hues and this one is not the best.  I ended up finding Black Sanding Sugar at Williams Sonoma that I used for my purpose instead of this and found that the flavor of that product also was better than these sparkles.  If you are not particular about your black color, these may be satisfactory, so I have given these two stars instead of the one I really wanted to select.  I am curious to know what is the difference between this product and the product that comes up at a lower price when a search is done for \"Wilton Black Sugar Sparkles\" on this website.  Image and description are exactly the same, and both are available now via the Amazon Prime Add On Program. Just like the icing used on expensive bought cakes!  Perfect to have on hand for \"emergency\" baking sessions.  Buy it you will like it! I used cream, and put it on a white cake and my husband just loved it. Note one box does one layer of a two layer cake. Using powdered sugar with butter and vanilla and milk tastes better and would be cheaper.  Would not buy this again. My friends and I all agree that this is the best tasting frosting! Mine comes out beautiful white, frosted the cake with smooth perfection and set up perfectly for decoration. This will be a staple for my future in cake decoration! As expected Delicious IcingGreat Flavor.  Mix up icing quickly to frost or decorate a cake or cupcakes. I am CONSTANTLY baking and this icing always gets awesome remarks. Most people are convinced it is homemade! It is light, fluffy and hard not to eat before you get it onto the cake!! The taste was fine, but it certainly did NOT make enough to frost even just the top of a 9x13 cake.  You would need maybe three of these. Growing up in a typical Puerto Rican family, all we knew was Pilon coffee. Now as an adult with my own family, nothing wakes me up like the aroma of freshly brewed Pilon. Hispanics are all about their coffee and Pilon is definitely one of the best. Try it, you will not be disappointed. unlike other islander coffee, Bold & Strong Cuban Coffee as expected. will purchase again. This coffee has a bitter taste but i enjoyed it i would buy it again  This is a nice roast and authentic Cuban bean. It is a good change from my normal coffeehas a nice taste and I use it with a super automatic machine with ease. Not an oily bean. First off, my usual espresso is the Starbucks brand.  I just like a strong flavor.  I want to HAVE to put some cream and suger in my coffee for it to be tolerable.  The first thing I noticed upon tasting PILON is that it is VERY strong yet VERY smooth.  I cannot say that for the Starbucks brand espressoactually at all.  I still put cream and suger in my americano's but I use less water, more espresso, and less sugar and cream.

      "Living in Chicago it is easy to find good espresso's, as intelligentsia and metropolis make excellent coffee for the larger brands here, but nothing really compares to the smooth cuban like flavoring of PILON.

      "This stuff is for REAL. I am an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, plus I have been a fan of Chef Prudhomme's delicious recipes for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, do not think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It is a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you are cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.  And you will not go wrong with the remainder of the items, which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MESSAGE. These are the BEST blended seasonings I have ever used. The added flavor is wonderful and provides and additional kick to meats and veggies. Item as described I love these spice combos and they save lots of individual measuring. They are as helpful in the kitchen as Minors Chicken Base. I am all for convenience as long as they help me produce delicious nutritious meals. These arrived quickly and well packed. Meh Love these.  Low carb, great taste.\n",

      "I used the magic meat to make a friend dinner and she spent a good part of the evening trying to figure out what combo of spices I would usedit's now my secret ingredient =) Great flavoring Gifted to sister. She loved the variety. When it is too cold or rainy to grill, use this on the range or in the broiler.  But turn on the fan first. Not worth the money. Good great taste one of the best spices on the planet and if do not have then you need to get this nice selection of spices Have not quite tried them all yet but these are great spices, yummy. A great vareity of Magic Blends. Each one brings a nice flavor to the meat that is recommended. The vegetable blend is used daily on just about every vegetable I eat. Very flavorful and tasty. Does not overpower the meat or vegetables. Add a lot of flavor. Worth it Great seasonings Coworker informed me to try Magic seasoning! I thank him after every meal prepared with this seasoning! Thanks Excellent selection Found it cheaper here than local glocery store. Great Buy. They really do all seem really close in flavor Not good at allall taste the same\n",
      "And meat seasoning taste like taco seasoning.\n",
      "Vegetable seasoning taste like something fake.\n",
      "I have not tried the chicken and seafooddoesnt even want to. Iwill return it great purchase.  Spices mixed real nice and ads great flavor to my cooking\n",
      "Would buy again I love these seasonings, and the variety is really convenient. I often mix my own seasonings, but when I do not have time, I use the Chef Paul seasonings. I have used all of these, and they go a long way. I keep these and other Chef Paul seasonings on hand at all times. I doubt Chef Paul had anything at all to do with these spices. They are surprisingly bland and all taste the same. You will literally get a much better result merely using sea salt and fresh ground pepper. The Magic Seasoning Blends are a staple in our house!  I keep them stocked in our pantry.  The blends are great, flavorful, and compliment a wide range of foods.  My favorites are the Barbeque and Salt Free Seasoning.  Alone or combined to create your own mix, these blends are awesome.  We love to use the Barbeque on steaks and ribs or mixed into baked beans.  The Fajita blend is great for making marinades or adding to ground beef for tacos.  The Salt Free and original Seasoning are great for anything and everything.  I will admit that I have yet to try the Salmon seasoning.  The others I have purchased previous and jumped at the chance to try this 5 pack.  You just cannot beat the price.  Most of these, if and when I can find them locally, are $5.50 and above.  I definitely will be purchasing these again.  Planning on gifting a set to my dad who LOVES to cook! I use one of these everytime I cook and I love these seasonings. After having used the seasoning salt for years, and running out of my current can, I decided to try the set.  I am glad I did.  I still use the seasoning salt the most, then the salmon seasoning next, and the others rarely.  Still, they are all good. UPDATE:-\n",

      "Chef Paul really got it spot on when he made one seasoning blend for vegetables, meat, poultry and seafood. They pretty much have the same main ingredients but each one has that extra couple of ingredients that makes what ever your having taste amazing! Today I thought I would try the Vegatable blend with my pasta w/pesto and OMG, did it taste so so good! I am so happy with the blends I got.\n",

      "UPDATE:- I just used the Meat Magic over the weekend and WOW! I put a generous amount on every new york strip before grilling along with coconut oil and clarified butter (ghee) and oh man it tasted amazing! I have done close to a hundred steaks with different seasoning and marinade and this has got to be the best so far!\n",

      "Thanks for the great product! Spices are great Excellent package deal.  This should last us for awhile.  Some of the best seasonings out there. I especially love the seafood, chicken and pork and veal seasonings. My only wish is that we could build our own sets or buy two or three of the flavors we want. I had to buy the 24 oz of  the veal and pork seasoningwhich is not replaceablein my mindto have it at all.  It lives in my freezer and I fill an old bottle as needed. these are only 2 ounce bottles.  I thought this was a 7 pack of 7.2 ounce bottles.  Read carefully!  NOT WORTH THE PRICE. As expected. Given as a gift to someone who loves cooking. I love Chef Paul seasoning. Taste is amazing. I was first introduced at santa monica seafood. they recommend I try the Fish seasoning on my grilled salmon. Wow! Taste blew my taste buds. It really adds flavor. The really cool thing is this set of four different seasonings has l;asted much longer than expected. there is allot of seasoning in each bottle. Whether I use this on ribs or pork shoulder, my barbecue turns out professional quality -- or better. Recently, I served St. Louis-cut ribs seasoned 24 hours ahead with Barbecue Magic. Not only were they a hit, several guests said they were better than the ribs at a famous upscale casual barbecue chain (and I agree). Chef Paul is the guru of herbs & spices, and like all his seasonings, this product is world class. The flavor is perfectly balanced with a light, natural smokiness, and is absolutely NOT hot. Perfect for beef, poultry, pork, as well as other meats and countless dishes. I have used all of Paul Prudhomme's seasonings and I love them all. They are spicy but not hot and very flavorful. If you are trying to use less salt this is the answer. I have been buying Chef Prudhomme's spices for well over a year.  I am never disappointed with them.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic, Meat Magic and even though it is not part of this pack I buy the toasted onion and garlic.  It is great when I bake fresh vegetables.  Before purchasing from Amazon compare the prices with his website because sometimes they are cheaper. This is a great and easy way to create genuine barbecue flavoring for your chicken, beef, or pork. You can use it either as part of a marinade or a rub. And you can use it when cooking on the grill, in the oven, on the stovetop, or in the barbecue pit. In a word, it is versatile. But not just that. The taste is great and provides a natural smoky flavor to whatever you are cooking. We have tried it on a number of occasions, and we have never been disappointed. The recommended serving size is 1/4 tsp., which means that a little goes a long way. Very good Wonderful assortment. Taste fantastic. Watch holes in top of shakers as they are large and the volume you expect is way higher when using them. I would recommend. My husband and I cannot eat much salt and this suites us fine.  It tastes so good.  You would not know how low the salt is so you can use it for flavoring.  I like that you have it for beef, pork,,poultry, etc.  Very good. We absolutely love these spices! They are our go to spices for any dish. The one for poultry is so good we needed to buy a large container of the Poultry one as it is used so much (found it in the supermarket). Also makes a great gift! Love this unique combo of spices! There is a wonderful undertone of anise. I cannot eat steak without it now My friends and family think I am a cooking genious.until I explain that I used Chef Paul's Magic Seasoning Blends. We were introduced to these blends at a dinner party, and our pantry could not be complete without keeping this product well stocked. From fish to beef, this product would be difficult to beat. This stuff has a bite to it, so start with a little and adjust from there.\n",
      "We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it, and WOW!!!!! burn your lips off hot..\n",
      "We have since learned to cut the rub with a bit of brown sugar and comes out perfect.. Usually a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products, this one does not blow my mind. The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it is cool enough to eat.\n",

      "The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer Bob's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this. I mix this with regular rolled oats to give it some better texture. Not sure if I would like the 6 grain but my hesitation was for naught.  Love this cereal but the amounts had to be halved (directions) or we would be feeding four instead of two!  Tastes great and especially good on those cold mornings when oatmeal just seems bland.  Would buy again. Excellent value.  I store these in the freezer and make pancakes out of them after mixing with equal parts yogurt and letting it sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours as explained in \"Nourishing Traditions\" by Sally Fallon. It is healthy, great when topped with sliced banana. Wholesome food with a glass of milk. Ordered this thinking it was 6 grain hot cereal more like the oatmeal style as with other brands, but its cream of wheat essentially, which is sooo gross to me.  If you like cream of wheat, you will like this, but it is NOT the oatmeal style. I like this product. I was not compensated or given item at a discount in exchange for this review. This is something I purchased because I either wanted or needed the item.\n",
      "This was an opps order as I meant to order steel cut oatmeal and got this instead. Happy it worked out this way because would have never tried otherwise. This stuff is great! It really volumes up after preparing as well. Less of an oatmeal type and more porridge. Easy peasy to prepare, I make a weeks worth in Tupperware and heat up what I need in morning with 1/2 cup milk with raisins dash of cinnamon or fresh fruit if I have. Fills the tummy nicely for several hours and reading the label cannot believe something so yummy us soo good for you. I whole heartily recommend this product. Great cereal, easy to make, great texture, baby loves it Good stuff.  Healthy, tasty, and best of allorganic, which is the reason I bought it.  I can get multi grain cereal at my local health food store but many times not organic.  Easy to order on line and probably a little less expensive for the larger quantities.  Lately I have been mixing it with a little Kaniwa, which my local Sprouts had on sale, and the combo is also good, and makes it 7 grain instead of 6. This is wonderful, filling cereal.  As part of a plan to improve my diet I began eating cooked cereal for breakfast every morning. This is a big part of that. It is very tasty, and filling. like this cereal Almost tasteless, not much bulk to it. This is as easy to make as instant oatmeal, but much more nutritious and cost effective. It has a wholesome, nutty taste. I eat it almost every day for breakfast, since I can make it quickly and easily at work. I just pour some of this hot cereal and water in my bowl without actually measuring but still trying to following the proportions in the label (1:3), and then I microwave it for 3 minutes. I usually add a little milk and top it with some fruit, like banana or raspberries. Sometimes right after cooking I stir in a little natural almond butter or peanut butter, which goes great with banana.\n",

      "Like all Bob's Red Mill products I have tried so far, I highly recommend this hot cereal! I love Bob's Red Mill, and their hot cereal is always delicious. I love this blend as it provides wonderful nutrients and acts as a great base for so many oatmeal combinations. I am very fond of this particular hot cereal (porridge). I usually cook in vanilla almond or soy milk for extra nutrition. Cooked in a double boiler, I can start it and do other things for 20-30 minutes before dishing up a satisfying breakfast for my family. If there is a bit left over, I add it to my pancake or waffle batter the next day. Yum! Overall a nice different hot cereal great if you make it with unsweetened cocoa powder and add your preferred sweetener Very good vanilla extract and organic too! This comes in a close second to my homemade organic vanilla extract. Will keep a bottle in my cabinet, while waiting for mine to \"develop\". Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it is organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It is a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they do not make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk. Wow! Simply the best tasting vanilla extract I have ever used! I hope it continues to be marketed with this kind of quality. As long as it is, it will be the only liquid vanilla flavor I use. We always use this vanilla.  It is wonderful for homemade ice cream, cookies, and cakes! Great flavor and quality product 1. Good quality vanilla extract\n",
      "2. You do not need a lot to feel it Very good vanilla extract, yes there is a difference in regular McCormick artificially flavored vanilla. This is actually an extract of real vanilla beans plus its organic to boot. Definately get this one if you want true vanilla flavor. Really like this!!! Has a great flavor.  Have used it in several recipes and it works well. Good quality however, just about every organic vanilla extract on the market has alcohol in it and a lot of alcohol because of an FDA regulation requiring 35% alcohol in vanilla extract (IMHO a useless stupid rule). I do not like alcohol. I find that buying the Grade A vanilla pods (which might take awhile if they come from Asia) allows me to make about five times the amount of extract for the same amount of money. My home-made extract is far stronger than even the best and without alcohol. I use a lot of vanilla. This bottle is small, and overpriced but it is better quality than the others in the same category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla is anti-carcinogenic. Alcohol causes disease. Do you think the FDA has your best interests in mind? Abby's advice: get pods and make a glycerin or oil extract yourself. Smells really good. I like the flavor.\n",

The bottle is plastic and small but the product has been a winner. I could never go back to the early days of using imitation vanilla! This is the best vanilla I have ever used. Excellent quality vanilla, My family is enjoying it very much.  Got here fast and perfect condition. Very good and even better knowing it is organic. Like I said I will continue buying this product.i do a lot of  cooking. This bottle is a steal, at Whole Foods (at least where I live) a bottle half this size costs twice as much. Before I was also using imitation vanilla, it smells okay but you can smell the fillers. This bottle smells like fresh, pure vanilla. I used it in a lemon poppy seed cake and it was delicious, mild and aromatic! My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL! This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast. So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job. Great flavor! Yummy bars Last night I  bought a Luna Chocolate Peppermint Stick for dessert with my evening meal. The texture was somewhat like saw-cutting grains stuck together but the flavor was quite good, one of the better-tasting nutrition bars. Not bad at all.

      "Gary Peterson They are my absolute favorites. I get them on auto delivery so I never run out. My 15 year old granddaughter loves them too. The best Luna bar so far. They come as close to the girl scout cookies, Samoas. This bar is healthy and DELICIOUS! These two adjectives are not usually used together when describing a health bar. I slightly heat this bar up in the microwave (at 10 seconds) and drink a glass of milk with this bar. Pretty standard fare for a Luna Bar, which is pretty much a good thing.  Soy crisps laden with pretzel pieces, peanuts, peanut butter smears and peanut butter chips; there is a peanut butter-y sort of candy coating on the bottom portion.  If only there were dark chocolate chips or pieces tossed in the mix  I guess I am just a chocoholic, but the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Luna-Bar-Chocolate-Dipped-Coconut-25-4-Ounce-15-Bars/dp/B00498HGG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Luna Bar Chocolate Dipped Coconut, 25.4-Ounce, 15-Bars</a>&nbsp;really raised the bar on Luna products for me.  All in all, a pretty tasty treat! I am an almond joy freak, so I was hoping this would be like those candy bars.  It is not- but it is really good anyway.  The chocolate is rich and delicious.  The coconut flavor is much more subdued than in an almond joy (or even in the coconut cookies I am familiar with)- but though it is subdued, you CAN tast it.  It is just not like a macaroon- but there is coconut flavor.  The bar has a nice texture- and I certainly love the way no one flavor overpowers the bar.  This is one excellent snack bar if you can handle the calories 190, and if you do not have a problem with 11 g of sugar. I do the order for a small grocery store.  When I saw this flavor in the order guide, I ordered it without hesitation.  Luna Bars always sell well, even though I personally am weary of Luna Bars with chocolate in them; the chocolate usually tastes funky, waxy.  Once it arrived, I tried one.  Soooo good!  It is hard to believe that this treat offers health benefits, it is THAT good.  It tastes like a macaroon.  Heaven.  It is now the top selling flavor at the store. Of all of the Luna Bar flavors, the Chocolate Peppermint Stick is my favorite.  It is very minty and easily chewable.  You do not have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it.  The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty.  If I had not looked at the wrapper, I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar (try doing that with other protein/meal replacement/nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration.)  There is also no vitamin taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals.  As it has less than 200 calories, it can be classified as a snack.  I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I cannot leave for lunch.\n",

      "I am pleased to report that this bar was delicious!  The chocolate/coconut blend is quite reminiscent of the flavor of a Mounds chocolate bar and not artificial tasting at all--rather, it was rich and chewy, with no unpleasant aftertaste.

I even like this peppermint better than the GeniSoy one. It did not melt in my messenger bag which is a benefit, but I am thinking about keeping an ice pack just in case, but it is nearing winter.

Then you are good to go and enjoy Peanut butter & Jelly soft bread sandwiches. I am getting the non salt version, though only 80 mg of sodium in this type, unlike alot of commercial brands that have 100 mg or more. The title of this review says it all. There is something seriously amiss with the thinking apparatus of anyone who will spend 23$ for one jar of peanut butter. No? This product has a good taste, it is also fortunate that unlike other brands this seems to be the easiest to spread on toast after taking out of the fridge (though it still is not as easy as it should be and does require patience) I first tried this about 15 years ago, and I have stocked it in my spice cabinet ever since! I use this on everything from Eggs to Pasta to Pizza. There is no salt in this stuff, just lots of Herbs, Spices, and Parmesan!\n",

I put this in all kinds of recipes (even mac & cheese) and it works miracles. It is THE BEST! I always use a lot of spices in my food, but this is the only one that I actually find myself craving at times. When I only had a couple teaspoons left I added it to my Parmesan shaker and it is heavenly that way as well. It is not salty, like most seasoning blends.  It adds just enough pizazz to anything.  It works on pizza, pasta, toast, rice, salad, just about anything that you can think of.  Let your imagination go wild!  This is a great product. :) This makes a lot of food taste greatsubs, deep fried mushrooms, pizza. Adds great flavor to pizzas and pasta.  Just shake it on.  I have used this for years but now I cannot find it local where I live.  Glad I found it on Amazon. We have been using this for years! The blend is unique and full of flavor. Most pizza seasonings we have bought tasted predominantly of oregano, but this one brings in layers of red pepper and Parmesan cheese without being too herbal.  We use it on pizza, but we also use it on spaghetti squash, grilled veggies, etc. We do not go crazy with it, a bottle lasts a long time. It is almost impossible to find locally now, so it is good to know that it is available here. I have been looking for a pizza seasoning and read the reviews and decided to try it. I really is an added taste to any slice of pizza. Not sure what all it has in it but it is really good!! Next stop is adding it to pasta. I have been using this for years! Great on tortellini with just some olive oil. Adds great flavor to any pasta or garlic bread. A staple in my kitchen. Always the best This is a must for anyone's spice cabinet, but cannot find it in my area.  This is a very great product. One of my favorite seasonings since it is so versatile. Goes great with pizza and pasta, but it is basically my default Italian seasoning. I found this too hot.  Too many hot pepper flakes. Been using this one for over 8 years. Never let us your pizza flavor become dull! Very good seasoning..among the top ones in my opinion. Give it a tryyou will not be sorry!\n",

I love this product.  I use it with pasta and even eggs and pizza of course.  Oh, yes, sometimes I sprinkle it over popcorn.  It came quickly and in good shape.  KayM  4.23.16 Absolutely delicious. I use it on pizza all the time. I have not tried it on pasta but I am sure it is delicious on that too. Love this for use on our pizza crust.  Everytime we make pizza, we sprinkle this on our pizza crust.  It tastes amazing and adds that \"special something\" to our meals.  Also throw it in pasta sauce! We love this seasoning so much I use it on frozen pizza too not just homemade. great product and vendor best out there,,,delicious Good stuff. Essentially, it is just parmesan cheese with some spices, so you are really paying alot for the brand name. I would not repurchase. Great Product really good spice like it adds flavor to pizza and pasta My husband loves pizza and loves this stuff too. So glad we found it and that amazon carries it I was really looking for something with more punch to it. Even though I have used it several times on pizza, I can only barely paste the spice. It seems to work better when used after your food is cooked. i use the red version(sweet and spicy) for regular pizza's.\n",
      "but this one i use on white sauce pizza's and also i use it in butterolive oil garlic sauces for pasta.\n",
      "it gives a nice zing to the oil and it tastes very good :-)\n",
      "its mostly garlic,herbs and parmasean cheese :-) I have used this for years but my local grocery stores do not carry it anymore. It is great with any pasta dish & I put it on all pizzas! I use this for all dishes that call for Italian seasoning. It works great for a variety of casseroles too. As always the \"Chef\" does not disappoint, this is SO good ! very flavorful.  Would recommend to anyone who would like to try and alternative seasoning that does not have all that sodium. This pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is, MAGIC!  It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce, meatballs, or any dish.  The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories, no fat, no salt, no carbohydrates and no MESSAGE to your food.  It also contains no preservatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good.  We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more!  I recommend it to you. If you want a full flavor, real-deal Olive Oil, this is it. I stir it in practically everything. It adds an entirely new and wonderful flavor to spaghetti sauce. I brush it on garlic bread. Uses are endless. Great stuff. I love this oil!  I love garlic and adding this oil with infused flavor to most dishes really adds to the taste.  For example, I make crostinis and instead of regular olive oil, I use Annie's and it makes them sing with flavor.  I even use it for the oil when I am roasting garlic. I am always trying to increase the flavor of food without the taste of spices being overpowering.  This oil is a good option for cooking foods, especially when stir frying meat and veggies.  The taste is strong enough without being STRONG. I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it is a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it is a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys! I like this WHEN it works. There Is inconsistency with the spray which is a major pain when working on a cake or wanting uniformity. Sometimes there is no color, sometimes speckles, sometimes its perfect. Just a light spray will do, it is pretty works great! I am writing this based on my use with FROSTING a cakesprayed this on a red velvet cake since cream cheese frosting has a bit of a yellow cast on it and this worked great and gave my cake a nice pearly look to it without compromising taste. I sprayed about 8 inches away from the cake and sprayed evenly on the topreally changed the top coat color nicely and evenly. Cake tasted fine. I love that this product does not taint the entire frosting as regular gel or food coloring would do. It is messy so be prepared to cover surface underlying baked good to be sprayed. No need to over spraygave one quick even coat and a few minutes later another one and it gave me the results I wanted.\n",
      "Would purchase again without a question! I purchased the Pearl Color mist here on Amazon and personally picked up the Black and Pink color mist at a local craft store and they all gave me great results and the attached pictures show all 3 colors on my cakes. Excellent way of capturing an ombr&eacute;/gradient look. The black mist was used on top of chocolate cake and hard t tell on photo but gave it a stunning metallic dark gray look.received many compliments! love it very pretty. good pigment works for 25th anniversary cake Shinny and chrome. This leaves such a fun gold color on food. Easy to apply and did not rub off works as well as could be expected I cannot decide if I like this or not. Prosit is gold, and shiny. Consit's hard to aim and get just the right amount if you are going freehand. I liked it sprayed on fondant that I then cut with cookie cutters to ice Christmas cookies. I did not like it as much sprayed directly on frosting on a caketoo sloppy. :) Sprayed white fondant with this to make it look like a pot.  Used a few coats to achieve real silver but it was great. Pretty disappointing. It did not work well, the color was very pale and even with multiple layers did not cover or make my food look gold. Loved itmade the waves on the \"ocean cake\" perfectnot to mention so easy I bought this to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. Very happy with the result because this is not a shiny or vibrant color. It is mat and it is perfect to recreate a metal look. Will buy again. I bought silver and gold colors to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. This is not a shiny bright gold or silver, it is mat in color. That makes it perfect for my horseshoe cookies. It takes a little practice to get this right but when you do, it is great. LOVE this product! I used it on a three layer rosette cake. Spraying a lot of silver at the bottom and slowly easing up toward the top for an ombre effect. The customer absolutely LOVED it and I had a ton of compliments on it as well. It truly gives a metallic effect without the odd taste! Rather pink and not red. Really cool spray.  Be sure that whatever your spraying is room temperature and not right out of the fridge otherwise the spray well kind a look dewy.  Use the spray on something that is already yellow for a better look .  You need several coats and the can is not very big .  Yellow looks awesome for my husbands Notre Dame cupcakes !\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "I have also tried red  and it works great!  I got the frosting basically pink in color with food dye and then I sprayed over the top with red .  Did not take a lot but man it was everywhere so do it outside or over a sink if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update #2:\n",
      " I have now used black and It turned out awesome for my galaxy cupcakes!  Started with blue frosting ,  Sprayed a little bit of black , then painted on some luster dust! This Color Mist was disappointing -- it just looked like an odd purple, not black. Despite repeat applications, the color never appeared black. The extra sprays made it seep under the cake stencil, so it just became a purple mess. I was able to scrape away the extra purple/blackish color and repair the whipped cream frosting, but I regret trying this product -- so I caution you if you need a dark color. When I was ordering for cake-decorating, the Color Mist had seemed likely to be the easiest way to decorate the cake top with a stencil. As it turns out, my back-up plan -- colored sugar -- actually worked much better. I cannot recommend this Color Mist, but CK's sanding sugar (if you want a very fine sugar with color) and crystal sugar (which is larger than granulated sugar) are excellent decorating products. I gave this Color Mist 2 stars only because the sprayer worked. This spray is amazing. Previously I just used a light dusting of silver to give this look, but it was not the same.\n",
      "I recently used this on cream cheese mints and they looked AMAZING.  No added taste or stickiness. It does not look gold at all.  It turned my oreos muddy.  But my students loved the \"golden\" oreos. am waiting for this saturday to do cupcake and change the colors of the cupcake on top once i do my cupcake i change the color on top it going to look perfect and beautiful love it I used this on Christmas cookies and everyone raved about how nice it made them look. great color coverage.  I used it to paint on white chocolate mold.  It comes out in a nice even spray and the color is a matte gold for the surface I painted.\n",
      "We did not eat the white chocolate so I cannot say if it affected the flavor or not.\n",
      "The head in the photo is what we painted with the gold spray.  We used 1.5 cans of the spray because we had to spray it with a few coats to get full coverage and to prevent any drip marks.  It is very quick drying and we only waited a few minutes between coats. I sprayed this on Oreos to make them look like gold coins to take to a St Patty's Day Party (minimal effort, maximum cute). The effect was great but it did lend a little off-taste to the cookies, like a sugar alcohol flavor. Also, I was concerned that this would make my cookies soggy but I left them to dry for about an hour and they texture was fine. Perfect It smelled like rust-oleum. I had to spray the cake in the garage. After all that messing around the paint did not stick to the side of the cake. Gross I had so much fun covering my cake pops with this. You must be careful not to over spray. I used it on Christmas cookies, and everyone was full of praise Not as shiny and chrome as I was hoping.\n",
      "It also burns your gums like 190 proof alcohol (I suspect that is what is in it).\n",
      "That said it worked well for Halloween.\n",
      "For all you warboys out there, you will be disappointed by my other Halloween results. I had the trick-or-treaters vote for Immortan Joe or Lord Humungus by picking candy from one bowl or another, Immortan Joe lost very badly. All hail Lord Humungus!\n",

Very fast shipping! works as expected I bought this for a project: pill identification.  I take multiple medications, and 9 of them are small, round, white ones.  I put them in those containers designed for a weekly dispensing.  Well, I would not know which pill was which, so I thought of these sprays, where I can color each with it is own identifying color would be a big help--and you know, I was right.

All they need is a dusting of the color--enough to distinguish one from the other.  Dries practically instantly, and does not affect the pill at all.  Pick up the parchment, and with the crease as your 'funnel', slide the pills back in their bottle.  Repeat with any other pills you may be doing this with.\n",
